These services are not intended to replace the logistics capacities of other organisations, nor are they meant to compete with the commercial market. Rather, they are intended to fill identified gaps and provide a last resort option in case other service providers are not available.  \n\nTransport services are planned to be available until 31 May 2019, with the possibility of further extension. Storage services are planned to be available until 30 June 2019. The services may be withdrawn before this date in part or in full, for any of the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Changes in the situation on the ground   \n\u2022 No longer an agreed upon/identified need   \n\u2022 Funding constraints  \n\nThis document will be updated, and services provided may change as the situation evolves and operational requirements develop.

Here, it intensified into Category 3 Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, once again bringing heavy rains and flooding to Malawi\u2019s southern districts and causing significant infrastructure damage to roads and bridges. 868,900 people are reported to be affected across 15 districts. The worst affected areas are Chikwawa, Machinga, Nsanje, Phalombe and Zomba.  \nOn 8 March, the Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster and requested international assistance. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), the country\u2019s national disaster management agency, is leading the response. In support of operations and to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas,  \nWFP - as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster globally - and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MOTPW) - who are lead ministry for Transport, Logistics and Communications Sector - will provide coordination and information management support, as well as facilitating access to common logistics services.",

While the death toll and injuries have been relatively low, damage to physical infrastructure, crops and livestock were significant, impacting on the livelihoods of the affected communities. The immediate humanitarian needs include ensuring access to the affected people, relocation of displaced families and provision of shelter, food, potable water and healthcare services, as well as restoration of electricity and communication.  \n\n- The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues, with increasing incidence. This recent rise in the number of new cases could be partly attributed to the disruption of response interventions following the latest spate of insecurity, including the attacks on the response teams, and continuing pockets of community mistrust. The response teams are beginning to restore full operations in all outbreak affected areas and hope to halt this trend.",

Cyclone Kenneth is the first tropical cyclone with the equivalent of hurricane strength to strike Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado since modern record-keeping began 60 years ago. According to the UN, the strike by Kenneth marked the first time in recorded history that Mozambique has been hit by two powerful cyclones in the same season.\n\nAs of 28 April, heavy rains continue in Cabo Delgado province and are expected to continue for the next 2-3 days. An assessment done in the northern city of Pemba confirmed that the communications status is very bad and urgently needed.",

    "title": "Mozambique: Tropical Cyclone Idai - Emergency Appeal n\u00b0 MDRMZ014 Operation Update no. 1",
    "body": "A. SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\n**Description of the disaster**\n\n Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique through the city of Beira, central Mozambique on 14th March 2019 at 23:30 GMT. Winds from the cyclone reached more than 100 miles per hour, and caused heavy rains affecting Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces. Mozambique National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) indicated that 1.5 million people were affected, including more than 140,000 people displaced \u2013 many sheltered across 139 evacuation centres, spontaneous settings and makeshift shelters. At the moment, some 603 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the cyclone, according to the most recent reports issued by INGC. At the same time, more than 1,500 people were injured, and more than 230,000 houses were damaged and destroyed. \n\nTropical Cyclone Idai has also affected Mozambique\u2019s food security and livelihoods in the long term, due to extensive damage to standing crops immediately before the harvest season due in the months of March-April as well as loss of seeds and tools1. The entire southern Africa region has been facing the effects of the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o with below-average cumulative rainfall and abnormally high temperatures for the 2018/19 season. The whole southern Africa region has suffered from sustained drought in recent years.\n\nFEWS NET also describes the impact of Tropical Cyclone Desmond, which brought localized floods and strong winds in areas around Beira and Dondo cities of Sofala Province through January 2019. Flooding from Desmond and other localized flooding resulted in the deaths of 1,285 cattle and other small animals and affected 60,167 hectares of crops.  \nThe impacts from the landfall of Tropical Cyclone Idai has destroyed over 715,000 hectares of crops in central Mozambique. \n\nWinds and floods also affected water and sanitation infrastructures across the provinces, especially in Beira. Stagnant water, lack of hygiene and sanitation condition provides a perfect breeding ground for cholera and malaria, which are both endemic diseases in the country. Reports from Handicap International published in late March indicate that 45 health centres have been destroyed, with 28 out 157 health facilities in Sofala province alone which are either entirely or partially destroyed. This further complicates the situation of people injured and especially vulnerable groups. One key example is pregnant women, of whom there are more than 75,000. From this figure, close to 43,000 are expected to give birth during the next six months, risking complications due to lack access to health facilities and care. Endemic diseases such as cholera and malaria pose an additional threat that grows at alarming rate. As of 12 April, official figures report at least 5,000 cholera cases in the country, and at least six deaths. Poor access to health facilities continues to be cut-off and hampering restocking of essential drugs and medical supplies in the health centres, as evidenced in the [Buzi rapid assessment](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/MOZ_Rapid_Assessment_Report_FINAL_5Apr.pdf).",

A total of 868,895 people were affected, including more than 86,976 displaced persons, with 60 deaths and 672 injuries recorded according to the Government. In total, 15 districts and two cities have been impacted.  \n\nThere have been no further floods since mid-March. Waters have receded, and displaced persons have started to return home. However, due to flood-related damage to people\u2019s houses, around 70 per cent remain in camps. More than 731,000 people need immediate food assistance and the situation is likely to worsen, as crops were destroyed by the floods.  \n\nConditions in evacuation centers are improving but camps remain cramped and unhygienic. Food and other supplies are not reaching all people affected. There have been three cases of cholera reported since the floods. Several schools continued being used as evacuation camps, negatively impacting on children\u2019s education.",

In addition, nearly 73,000 people were sheltering in an estimated 65 accommodation centers across the country\u2019s Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zamb\u00e9zia provinces due to the cyclone as of April 22, the GRM reports. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) noted that the increase in the number of displaced people during the past week was likely due to individuals in Sofala relocating from unofficial collective sites to GRM-recognized accommodation centers.\n\n- Humanitarian agencies continue to monitor and respond to health challenges\u2014including the spread of vector-borne and waterborne diseases\u2014in cyclone-affected areas in Mozambique. Health actors had reported more than 6,600 cholera cases and eight cholera-related deaths, in Mozambique as of April 22, and approximately 14,900 malaria cases in Sofala\u2019s Beira city, and Buzi, Dondo, and Nhamatanda districts as of April 23. In response, relief actors have distributed approximately 116,600 mosquito nets and are conducting disinfection activities in health centers and schools across affected areas.\n\n- Local authorities in Zimbabwe estimate that the cyclone displaced approximately 60,000 people in the four worst-affected districts. Relief actors have provided emergency food assistance to approximately 200,000 people in affected areas since the beginning of the emergency. Relief actors are also prioritizing the distribution of blankets and shelter supplies to address needs related to the recent cold and wet weather in cyclone-affected areas.\n\n- On April 18, the Government of Malawi (GoM) and other stakeholders held a meeting to discuss a timeline for internally displaced person returns. The GoM had established approximately 60 internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Chikwawa and Nsanje districts as of mid-April for the estimated 87,000 individuals displaced by the flooding.",

It covers the period from 17 April to 23 April 2019. The next Situation Report will be issued on or around 1 May.* \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n\u2022 Latest estimates indicate that 10,000 people are displaced in Masvingo, Zaka, Bikita, and Gutu districts, which brings the total estimate of displaced people across the affected districts to 70,000, pending detailed verification.\n\n\u2022 Oral cholera vaccination has reached 384,000 people in Chipinge and Chimanimani districts.\n\n\u2022 About 8,750 children under age 5 have been screened for acute malnutrition, and those found to be malnourished referred appropriately.\n\n\u2022 About 91,000 people have regained access to a sufficient quantity of water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Loss of and damage to essential teaching and learning materials have impacted 95 per cent of schools in the affected districts.\n\n\u2022 Funding for the cyclone component of the Flash Appeal amounts to US$10.3 million so far (17 per cent of requirements).\n\n\u2022 Huge funding gaps exists across all clusters, which can be a challenge in continuing to address the humanitarian needs of the affected people.\n\n\u2022 The formal establishment of the cluster coordination among international partners has considerably improved the humanitarian operation. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nThe humanitarian response to cyclone-affected districts in the eastern part of the country is increasing as all wards are now accessible by road, although some only by 4X4 vehicles. Many clusters have completed or are about to complete in-depth assessments in all affected districts, which will afford a more refined analysis of the needs and a tailored humanitarian response in the short term, and also contribute to the medium- to long-term recovery plan. \n\nOne suspected cholera case was identified on the border between Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In addition to the ongoing first round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign, cholera preparedness has been stepped up Chipinge to prevent cholera from spreading into Zimbabwe from Mozambique, particularly given the significant movements of people across the border for the recent Easter holidays. \n\nThe priority remains to work with the government in finding the most appropriate steps to address the short-, medium- and longer-term needs of the displaced population whose houses the cyclone destroyed, particularly ensuring that transit camps fulfil international standards.",

    "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- The 2018/2019 season was the driest since at least 1981 in central and western parts of the region.  \nThe drought resulted in crop failure, reduced forage, and poor water availability.\n\n- A delayed and erratic onset of rains, mid-season dry spells, and early cessation of rains in several parts of the region have contributed to poor crop production expectations in many areas.\n\n- Tropical Cyclone Idai brought strong winds and heavy rains to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, resulting in fatalities and severe damage, most significantly in Mozambique.\n\n- Rainfall performance in a few north-eastern areas has resulted in good harvest prospects there.\n\n- National crop production assessments are currently underway, and will help to quantify the impacts of the 2018/2019 seasonal performance on food availability. \n\n**Summary**\n\nA strong drought affected central and western parts of the region during the 2018/2019 rainfall season. Many parts of southern Angola, northern and southern Botswana, northern Namibia, north-western South Africa, southern and western Zambia, and north-western Zimbabwe, received their lowest seasonal (October-to-March) rainfall totals since at least 1981 (Figure 1, brown colours). The low seasonal rainfall totals observed in the region were primarily the result of (a) delayed and erratic onset of rains in several areas that resulted in reduced area planted and poor germination, (b) mid-season dry spells of varying duration that resulted in moisture stress and wilting of crops, and (c) an early cessation of rains across central areas that further exacerbated pre-mature wilting of crops. Additionally, in mid-March, Cyclone Idai destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cropland in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Cumulatively, these factors reduced end of season production prospects due to reductions in planted area, reduced yields, and outright crop failure in some areas. At a local scale, the poor seasonal performance will have the most severe impacts in cropping areas where widespread crop failure occurred, as well as areas with preexisting high levels of food insecurity due to poor 2017-2018 seasonal production. At a regional level, some of the most affected areas are high maize producing areas, which will negatively impact regional maize supplies. In many countries, survey teams are currently in the field generating crop production estimates that will better quantify the availability of food crops at sub-national and national level.\n\nThe drought also affected water supplies for domestic, industrial and agricultural (irrigation and livestock) usage. Forage for livestock was also negatively impacted, and reductions in pasture availability will be experienced in the worst affected areas as the dry season progresses. The poor grazing and water conditions are negatively affecting livestock. Over 30,000 drought-related cattle deaths were recorded in Namibia between October 2018 and April 2019.\n\nA few north-eastern parts of the region received good rainfall for much of the season, including central and northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, parts of Tanzania, and north-eastern Zambia. Good harvests are expected in some of these areas.",

This activity involved 60 households moving from Axel to IFP Inhamizua, 25 households moving from Chota to IFP Inhamizua and 50 households moving from Escola Prim\u00e1ria Completa de Matadouro to San Pedro. It was later realised that an additional relocation of Approx. 20 individuals had taken place from Dondo to IFP Inhamizua.  \n\nIt is worth noting that immense support was accorded by Directors of the schools in Chota and IFP Inhamizua who were fully involved in the process including briefing the IDP\u2019s and resolving arising issues. In addition, a lot of support was also given by the team of volunteers who guided IDPs to their respective tents including carrying luggage as well as ensuring that the children were not lost.\n\n**Relocation at Matadouro.**\n\nThe population at Matadouro were to relocate to San Pedro. According to the population, they had been informed of the planned relocation three days in advance and also informed that it was voluntary.  \n\nHowever, it was not clear to them about where they were relocating to.  \nSome families preferred to return home as long as they were issued with shelter kits to reconstruct their houses. A protection multi-functional team comprising of UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM and Save the children were on ground to monitor the process to ensure that protection issues were identified and potential risks mitigated.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. It was discovered by the MFT team that the site they were to relocate to; San Pedro was not ready.\n\n2. WASH facilities had not been completed. No CFS, TLS or demarcated cooking area.\n\n3. The population had received 25 kgs of rice and 1liter cooking oil.\n\n4. Vaccination against cholera were on-going on site.\n\n5. List had been prepared by classroom leaders of those intending to voluntarily relocate and those intending to stay.\n\n6. At around 11:00a.m the activity was halted due to food distribution by WFP? As soon as the community heard about it, they stormed into the school demanding assistance as they felt that they were equally affected.\n\n7. Relocation to the new site took place that evening after the agitated community had returned home.\n\n8. At the site, there was no humanitarian actor present to receive the population, no manifests were used and INGC ensured that Escola Prim\u00e1ria Completa de Matadouro was empty.\n\n**Relocation at Chota**\n\nThe affected group at Chota was to relocate to IFP Inhamizua. A protection multi-functional team comprising of UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM were on ground to assess protection risks pre, during and after the relocation. Fortunately, INGC shared list of those intending to relocate and those requesting to remain behind. Child protection team enhanced the data shared to enable aggregation based on age cohorts and gender.",

The population is mostly women and children, and men were said to be out trying to find work. Out of 32 tents at the site, most are occupied by women and children. Boys who are 15 years and above stay with their fathers. In addition to the tents, several families were staying in a brick building within the compound.\n\nMetuchira resettlement site is one of the three \u201cresettlement\u201d areas identified by GoM/INGC. The other two are Xiluvo and Ndeja. 221 households are expected to be allocated individual plots. 186 plots have been demarcated with 47 tents already pitched and the same number of families resettled.  \n\nOn the day of monitoring, a multi-partner visit was held in Nhamatanda to meet with the Municipality Administrator and meet IDPs in transit sites as well as in permanent relocation sites. The Protection Cluster was represented by UNICEF, IOM and UNHCR. The UNHCR Representative in Mozambique and Assistant Regional Representative (Admin), ROSA also joined the delegation.  \n\nAccording to local authorities, 3,245 families live in accommodation centres. It was reported that like in other \u2018resettlement\u2019 sites, lack of basic facilities (such as WASH and Health, functioning schools) and support for livelihoods exposed the population to protection risks, particularly the most vulnerable. Similarly, the team recorded tensions between host communities and IDPs over aid distribution.\n\n**General protection & safety**\n\n\u00c1gua Rural Accommodation Centre                \nThe centre is located near the Nhamatanda town, the population stated that they felt safe there.  \n\nMetuchira Resettlement Site              \nLocal population at the nearby village said that most of the new families are known to them as they are from the neighbouring villages.",

Women and men are accommodated in separate tents, and boys above the age of 14 expected to move to the men\u2019s tent. According to the camp leader, 650 families were registered as cyclone-affected families. Lists were being prepared and no accurate information was available at the time, including the number of tents occupied by men and those occupied by women.

When queried, the women stated that the men were out working. However, with a majority of tents occupied by women, and only around 5 tents reserved for men, whether or not the men were staying in the camp site remains unverified.  \n\nMost families reported that they had not receive any information regarding how long they will remain in the Accommodation Centre and of the plans for \u2018resettlement\u2019. The women stated that they preferred to receive lands away from the coast as they did not wish to experience another disaster due to cyclone and storms. Some expressed wish to return home and fix their homes; others had no such options as they were in rented houses.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nOn the evening of Thursday 14 March Category 3 Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Beira, Mozambique\u2019s fourth largest city, bringing high wind speeds of up to 224 km per hour and heavy rains. The cyclone followed extensive flooding throughout the Mozambique provinces of Zamb\u00e9zia, Tete and Niassa in early March that caused significant infrastructure damage, interrupting regular supply routes. According to OCHA an estimate of 1.85 million persons need humanitarian assistance and more that 50 locations remains hard to reach in Nhamatanda, Buzi and Chibabava district.  \nThe National Disaster Management Agency (INGC) is leading the response. The Logistics Cluster was activated on 20 March.\n\nWFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has been requested by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) to provide coordination and information management support, and facilitate access of common logistics services to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver life-saving items across affected areas.\n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks**\n\nThe cyclone has seriously damaged logistics infrastructures across the affected areas including warehouses, roads and bridges.  \nDespite significative improvements in accessibility, many of the damaged infrastructures that were identified continue to require repair. While Buzi City is now accessible to light vehicle and trucks up to 20 mt, south Buzi remains extremely difficult to access by road, boats and helicopters are still the main delivery modalities to reach this location. In Muanza, the road from Dondo to Caia remains very difficult to access and the broken Nhamatanda bridge significantly affects the passage of trucks from Tica to Inchope. In Mossurize, the N260 road is still impossible to pass, despite ongoing reparation efforts.\n\nOne month after the cyclone, the current logistics bottlenecks are as follow:\n\n- Air transport to hard to reach locations \n- Road transport for roads difficult to pass \n- Temporary storage support in the main humanitarian hubs",

The Situation Report builds on Flash Updates #1 through #15 and provides detailed information on the situation and response by sector. The next report will be issued as of 24 April 2019.* \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n\u2022 More than 700 people were relocated from Beira to Guara Guara on 20 and 21 April. The relocations were reportedly organized and orderly, according to the Government and protection partners.\n\n\u2022 The number of internally displaced people living in accommodation centres decreased to 72,793 people across 65 sites in Manica (32); Sofala (26); Tete (5) and Zambezia (2), as of 22 April.\n\n\u2022 Malaria cases in Sofala continue to rise, with 14,863 malaria cases registered as of 7 a.m. on 22 April, in Nhamatanda (6,125), Dondo (4,484), Beira (4,134) and Buzi (123).\n\n\u2022 Many locations remain inaccessible or hard-to-reach by road, including in Buzi, Chibabava, Nhamatanda and Sussendenga districts.

The relocations were reportedly organized and orderly, according to the Government and Protection partners. Child protection volunteers who welcomed the group reported that there were no incidents of separation or any other risks for children, the elderly or persons with disabilities, during the movement. Separated children were re-united with their families on sight, except for one whose mother did not receive communication on time. There were some concerns regarding potential tensions between the relocated families from IFAPA and those previously sheltered at Escola Secundaria in Guara Guara, who reportedly felt that they should have been considered first for the allocation of permanent plots. \n\nAs of 22 April, the overall number of displaced people living in accommodation centres countrywide reduced to 72,793 people across 65 sites in Manica (32); Sofala (26); Tete (5) and Zambezia (2). There were still 26 accommodation centres hosting 45,362 people in Sofala as of 21 April, according to the Government. The Government has prioritized the closure of the Sao Pedro (180 families); Samora Machel (288 families of which 253 come from Praia Nov); and the Adventist Church (28 families) shelters. Humanitarian and Protection partners are advocating for inclusive, timely, transparent and safe population movements that supports dignity and considers the needs of the host community.  \n\nMore than one month into the response, many locations remain inaccessible or hard-to-reach by road. Road repairs are ongoing, including in Buzi, Chibabava, Nhamatanda and Sussendenga districts. However, heavy rains in mid-April again made key secondary and tertiary roads inaccessible. For example, nearly all areas in Nhampoca in Nhamatanda and many areas in Buzi remain hard-to-reach.",

An estimated 1.85 million people across Mozambique have been affected, according to the UN. As of 14 April, 603 people are confirmed dead and 1,643 injured according to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC). 239,731 houses were identified by authorities as totally destroyed (111,202), partially destroyed (112,745) or flooded (15,784). 70,610 displaced people are sheltering in 69 sites across Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete. A World Bank commissioned rapid remote assessment to estimate the financial impacts of Cyclone Idai suggests as much as USD 773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture.\n\nOn 14 April, the Ministry of Health confirmed 4,979 cases of cholera; 4,946 cases have received treatment and are in recovery. Most of the cases reported have been in Beira, followed by Nhamatanda and Dondo. The Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign ended on 9 April, with 803,125 people vaccinated. 11 Cholera Treatment Centres have been established by health cluster partners and government in response. IOM\u2019s emergency health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programming experts are being deployed from across the region to Mozambique in order to support these urgent concerns.\n\nIOM\u2019s main office in Maputo is coordinating response activities with sub-offices in Tete and Beira to support the emergency response. In addition, IOM has deployed over 30 international technical experts on Shelter, Camp Management, Health,  Protection, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and Early Recovery to enhance response capacity and initiate new activities.  IOM is co-leading the Shelter-NFI Cluster with IFRC and supporting INGC within the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Task Force.\n\nIn order to respond to the humanitarian needs of 1.85 million people affected by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, IOM is appealing for USD 36.4 million for its emergency response for the next six months to September 2019. The UN is urgently seeking an additional USD 282 million of relief aid over the next three months to 30 June 2019. As of 14 April, the Humanitarian Response Plan is funded at USD 78.5M, 23.3% of funding requirements of USD 337M.",

Prior to the relocation, the government, supported by protection partners, organized a \u201cgo-and-see\u201d visit for three community leaders from the IFAPA site in Beira to inspect the conditions in the sites in Guara Guara. The leaders reportedly expressed content with the situation in the sites and were later asked to share their findings with the entire community in IFAPA. Construction of temporary latrines for the new arrivals was completed on 18 April. The authorities have, however, requested additional support with tents and non-food items. UNICEF has provided a large tent (102 meters), which will be erected by COSACA to serve as backup, in case more shelter is required.\n\nMany interior roads remain inaccessible, as numerous secondary roads were washed away or cut off. In Sofala and Manica provinces, efforts are underway to ensure that life-saving assistance reaches areas hard-to-reach or inaccessible by road, including in Buzi, Chibabava, Nhamatanda and Sussendenga districts.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of displaced people living in accommodation centres has increased by more than 8,000 people since 18 April, according to Government reports.

    "body": "**Overview**\n\n- This Weekly Bulletin focuses on selected acute public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 66 events in the region. This week\u2019s edition covers key ongoing events, including:\n\n- Cyclone in Mozambique      \n- Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo     \n- Lassa fever in Nigeria     \n- Hepatitis E in Namibia     \n- Chikungunya in the Republic of Congo.\n\n- For each of these events, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided.\n\n- A table at the end of the bulletin gives detailed information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have been controlled and thus closed.\n\n- Major issues and challenges include:\n\n- Although the situation in Mozambique in the aftermath of tropical cyclone Idai is improving amidst the massive response efforts, the effects remain including isolated communities that still require air or boat operations for mobile clinics. The risk of communicable diseases including an ongoing outbreak of cholera and rise in the number of malaria cases is being raised by the presence of stagnant flood water, continued limited access to safe water and overcrowding at accommodation centres. The recent launch of the oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign in the most affected districts with a coverage of 98.6% is expected to provide short-term relief. Expansion of the Early Warning and Alert Response System (EWARS) across more areas with support from WHO and partners is expected to enhance quick and timely response to outbreaks in order to mitigate their impact. However, with only 6.6% of the funds requested provided so far, there is a dire need to breach this funding gap in order to prevent a full-scale humanitarian crisis and help restore the health system to normality.\n\nChallenges associated with insecurity and community resistance continue to characterize the response to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo with two recent incidences of attack against healthcare facilities which resulted to the loss of life of one of WHO Epidemiologist and injury to several other Ministry of Health staff. The outbreak is still restricted to two provinces, North Kivu and Ituri, with Katwa health zone in North Kivu reporting about 52% of the cases in the past 21 days.  \nWHO and partners continue to support the government to scale-up response to the outbreak including strengthening case investigation, contact tracing, infection prevention and control, vaccination, and other response activities.  \nFollowing the recommendations of the International Health Regulations (IHR)  \nEmergency Committee meeting, community awareness and mobilization activities have been intensified particularly in areas with resistance at the epicentre of the outbreak. However, the ongoing gap in funding needs urgently to be filled to ensure unhindered implementation of response measures.",

    "body": "This Situation Report is produced by OCHA Regional Office for Southern and Eastern Africa in collaboration with humanitarian partners.  \nThe Situation Report, which covers the period 17 to 18 April, builds on Flash Updates #1 through #15 and provides detailed information on the situation and response by sector. The next report will be issued as of 20 April 2019. \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n\u2022 Heavy rains and strong winds on 15 and 16 April have damaged roads and shelters in several locations.\n\n\u2022 The number of internally displaced people living in accommodation centres decreased to 68,974 people across 67 sites in Manica (32); Sofala (27); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3), as of 18 April.\n\n\u2022 There were 12, 297 malaria cases reported as of 18 April, compared to 11,565 cases on 17 April, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\n\u2022 The number of new cholera cases reported each day is beginning to decline, following the successful Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign. \n\n\u2022 More than 1.3 million people had received food assistance in the provinces of Sofala, Tete, Zambezia and Manica, as of 18 April, according to the Food Cluster. \n\n1.85M People in need \n\n6,258 Cholera cases \n\n1.3M People reached with food assistance \n\n~69K IDPs in accommodation centres \n\n12,297 Malaria cases in Sofala Province \n\n400 Displaced people identified and in need of assistance in Manica. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**     \n\nHeavy rains and strong winds on 15 and 16 April caused damage to shelters and roads in multiple locations, impacting communities that were only just beginning to recover from the floods and making humanitarian access more difficult. In Guara Guara, around 50 per cent of the tents used by displaced people for temporary shelter were reportedly damaged or destroyed, leaving people either out in the open or crowded into the over-congested remaining shelters. For several isolated communities, the fresh rains washed away roads that had only recently become passable, including in the Buzi area.    \n\nThe continued wet conditions pose a risk for increased disease outbreaks. As of 18 April, 12,297 malaria cases had been reported, according to the Ministry of Health. The number of cholera cases reported daily, however, continued to decline, as the effects of the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign began to be felt.    \n\nMeanwhile, the number of displaced people living in accommodation centres continued to reduce, according to Government reports. As of 18 April, there were 68,974 people in 67 sites across Manica (32); Sofala (27); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3); a reduction of about 1,800 people and two sites in Sofala province from 16 April.    \n\nEducation Partners are supporting the Government to clear schools that have been vacated by IDPs to support the resumption of regular classes. Schools in Nhamatanda resumed on 15 April. However, students have reported challenges, including the lack of books, school bags and uniform, as well as concerns over the dilapidated state of the school structures.  \n\nEducation partners, in collaboration with the Government and UNDP, have raised concern over the presence of asbestos in debris, including in schools and are taking action to mitigate the risks.",

As of 18 April, over 600 deaths had been recorded and more than 130 000 people had been displaced.\n\n- Prior to the Cyclone and the floods that preceded and followed it, an estimated 1.78 million people were already severely food insecure in Mozambique, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN).\n\n- These numbers will rise now that the water has receded and the extent of the damage to productive, agricultural and fisheries infrastructure and assets becomes clear. To support the resilience of affected people, FAO is already working to deliver targeted expertise, seeds and livestock to ease immediate food and nutrition needs, ensure the main winter harvest is not missed and diversify livelihoods to promote recovery and build resilience to future shocks.\n\n- FAO is seeking an initial USD 19 million to rebuild critical agricultural and fisheries infrastructure, resume local food production and support livestock owners. So far, USD 3.85 million has been raised, which can immediately reach some 95 000 people. A gap of USD 15.5 million \u2013 80 percent \u2013 remains.",

The electricity company (EDM) expects to re-establish completely the system within 30 \u2013 60 days depending on the level of damage in affected districts. The significant progress made by EDM this week was the reestablishment of electricity at the waste water treatment system in Beira and at the intake of the water supply system in Dondo.  \n\nAs of 18 April 2019, there were a total of 6,385 cholera cases recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and a death toll of 8. Most of the cases have been reported in Beira (4,524), followed by Dondo (1,013), Nhamatanda (726) and Buzi (122). From 27 March to 18 April a cumulative number of 12,917 Malaria cases were recorded in Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi districts. Most of the of the cases (41.2% - 5,319) were registered in Nhamatanda district. Although the total cumulative cases of Cholera are higher than the one reported last week, the overall trend of the daily cases is reducing (e.g: from 17 April to 18 April there was a reduction from 127 to 63 cases) in all affected districts. One week after the completion of cholera vaccination campaign in Sofala province, the health authorities are expanding the vaccination to other risk areas within the province, namely, Munza, Cheringoma, Nhamatanda and Buzi districts. As of 17 April 2019, 27,026 people out of 57,906 were vaccinated in those districts representing 46.7 per centof the target.  \n\nAs of 20 April 2019, there were 26 accommodation centres hosting 45,362 people in the districts of Dondo, Buzi, Nhamatanda, Chibabava and Beira of Sofala province. According to INGC, as of 20 April 2019, there are in total 66 transit/accommodation centers with 77,003 people in the provinces of Zamb\u00e9zia (3), Manica (32), Sofala (26) and Tete (5).  \n\nThe Government continues with the delineation of land plots to be assigned to the displaced population currently hosted in accommodation centers. To date, a total of 2,394 plots were delineated in Sofala, of which 1,129 were already assigned to the displaced population in Nhamatanda, Buzi and Caia districts. According to the Provincial Authorities, in Sofala province, there is a need to resettle about 10,974 families and 650 families were already resettled in Caia and Nhamatanda districts.  \n\nThis week, in Sofala province (Beira and Buzi) at least four transit/accommodation centers were closed and about 3,137 people were transferred to new sites. On 20 April 2019, the Government started the transfer of 92 families from Buzi and hosted in IFAPA accommodation center to their area of origin (Buzi district). As an effort of putting in place minimum conditions for the returnees in Guara-Guara accommodation center (Buzi district), UNICEF supported the water company (FIPAG) to provide safe drinking water (water tanks and pump) to about 900 families (4,500 people). In addition, UNICEF also provided 200 slabs and tarpaulins to build latrines in accommodation centers.  \n\nThe Government, jointly with the UN System, the European Union and the World Bank, have launched a post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) to evaluate impact, damages and losses across key sectors and to inform a national post disaster recovery strategy. UNICEF is co-leading in the education, WASH and social protection sectoral components of the PDNA, working with the Government and partners to quantify damages and loses, as well as required inputs for early recovery and reconstruction. The process in expected to be completed in May 2019, with the PDNA assessment highlighting financial requirements for the national recovery framework.",

However, the overall epidemiological trend for the outbreak is decreasing.\n\n\u2022 Malaria cases continue to rise, and some 11,565 cases were reported in Sofala Province as of 16 April.\n\n\u2022 The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster continues to provide connectivity in the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and another 19 sites in Beira, as well as in Buzi, Grudja and Nhamatanda, to support the scaling up of the humanitarian response.\n\n\u2022 More than 335,000 children and over 7,800 teachers have been affected by the floods as of 16 April, and need emergency educational supplies, according to the Government and partners.\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW** \n\nMore than 70,000 people continued to seek shelter in 69 accommodation centres across Manica (32); Sofala (29); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3), as of 16 April, according to the Government. This is less than half the number of accommodation centres and half the number of people in such sites at the beginning of April, when there were 156 sites hosting more than 146,000 people. Unverified reports indicate that some families have begun to return home to start their lives, while others have moved from accommodation centres to new collective sites. Humanitarian partners are supporting the Government in assessing the status of proposed relocation sites and continue to advocate for safe, dignified, voluntary and informed returns; in addition to provision of basic services. \n\nMany displaced people are living in temporary settlements with limited access to safe water and sanitation, putting them at high risk of diseases such as cholera, malaria and measles. Some 6,032 cholera cases had been reported as of 0700hrs on 16 April in Sofala Province. An oral cholera vaccination campaign that ended on 9 April reached 98.6 per cent of the target, according to health partners. Epidemiological trends by the Ministry of Health show a decrease in the number of daily cholera cases starting on 14 April; attributed to the successful reach of the vaccination campaign. There are reportedly fewer patients in Cholera Treatment Centres (CTC), and most are normally discharged within two hours, according to health partners. WFP is supporting three cholera treatment centers in Beira with food assistance. There are, however, still many cases of diarrhea not related to cholera being reported, according to health partners.  \n\nPlanting for a second 2019 harvest in October-November must be completed in the coming days, according to WFP. FAO has begun the distribution of maize, bean and vegetable seeds and tools to smallholder farming families in Sofala and Manica provinces. WFP is supporting the effort by providing food assistance to the families to ensure seeds are planted rather than consumed. More than 715,000 hectares of crops \u2013 primarily maize \u2013 were washed away ahead of the main April\u2013May harvest, deepening food insecurity. Other key sources of income, like livestock and fisheries, have also been badly affected.  \n\nGiven the magnitude of the damage caused by the cyclone and ensuing floods, Mozambique\u2019s recovery needs will be significant. A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment has been launched by the Government this week and is expected to highlight areas for investment in improved food/nutrition security and social protection programmes.",

The Situation Report builds on previous Flash Updates and provides more detailed information on the situation and response. It covers the period from 10 April to 16 April 2019. The next Situation Report will be issued on or around 24 April.*\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n\u2022 Local authorities estimate that 60,000 people are displaced in the four worst-affected districts (Buhare, Chimanimani, Chipinge and Mutare).\n\n\u2022 In light of this week\u2019s wet weather, upcoming cold weather, and expected movement of people for Easter holiday, operational urgencies will include distribution of non-food items, especially blankets, ensuring adequate temporary shelter for all, and oral cholera vaccination.\n\n\u2022 Oral cholera vaccination targeting 336,699 people in Chipinge and 139,635 in Chimanimani is under way.\n\n\u2022 Food Security Cluster partners have so far assisted an estimated 155,000 people in the worst-affected areas of Chimanimani and Chipinge, out of an initial target of 270,000.\n\n\u2022 About 70,000 people have gained access to a sufficient quantity of water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene, out of an initial target of 270,000.\n\n\u2022 Confirmed funding for the cyclone component of the flash appeal is $10.1 million, or 17 per cent of requirements.\n\n\u2022 The UN system together with the humanitarian partners are fully engaged with the Government of Zimbabwe to provide all comprehensive humanitarian assistance across all sectors.\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nOne month after Cyclone Idai affected 270,000 people in eastern Zimbabwe, clusters are activated, and in the most-heavily-affected districts (particularly Chipinge and Chimanimani), aid materials are flowing and coverage is rising, although gaps remain. Humanitarian partners are working to reach all people in need with essentials such as blankets: night-time temperatures (currently around 15 degrees Celsius) will soon fall to 10\u00b0 C or lower. \n\nWHO reports an increase in acute respiratory infections, which may indicate that some people are suffering exposure.  \nRoads to all wards have become accessible by 4x4, although rainfall may make the dirt roads impassable again. \n\nBad weather is forecast for this week\u2014thunderstorms and up to 3cm of rain\u2014which will ground the WFP helicopter, and might threaten the temporary road repairs. OCHA and Logistics Cluster have therefore advised partners to pre-position all necessary materials in Chipinge and Chimanimani, in case their roads are cut off again. \n\nWHO and partners are administering oral cholera vaccine in all affected areas this week, before the expected visits of many Mozambicans to their relatives in neighbouring districts of Zimbabwe for the Easter holiday. \n\nData from new assessments (including for early recovery) is being assimilated and compiled, which together with upcoming assessments should yield refined figures for people in need and targets. One key ambiguity for assessments to resolve is the location and intentions of displaced people whose houses were destroyed or damaged beyond habitability: many are reportedly staying with relatives or host families, but many of these may be in other districts. Host families are also likely to need support.

These maps are updated two times per week. See maps on this link https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/ operations/mozambique/health/infographics\n\nCollaboration on the Flash Appeal Emergency Response Plan and health priorities to appeal for an urgent $12 million for all implementing health agencies in the next month.\n\n**BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT**\n\nOn 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique, bringing devastation to the port City of Beira and surrounding areas in the central region of the country over 1.85 million people were affected. One month after this devastating event. On the 15th of April, one month after this devastating event the official there were still nearly 1.2 million people in need. The death toll remained at 603 people and the number of houses destroyed or damaged 239,731. The number of displaced people in collective sites at 70,610.\n\nIn Mozambique, prior to the cyclone emergency, despite improvements in infant mortality rates and significant improvements in access to PHC (Primary Health Care), health and nutrition indicators were of concern: <5 mortality rate (78.5 per 1000), Maternal mortality ratio (407 per 100 000 live births), 43% of children under five years of age are stunted and 6% are wasted, with no improvement in prevalence over the last 10 years.\n\nThe cyclone caused widespread damage to health facilities (with at least 77** health centres damaged or destroyed), while also leaving large numbers of the population cut off or displaced away from their normal health facilities. Sanitation facilities such as latrines were destroyed by the storm and floods, with consequent contamination of wells and boreholes.\nThe risk of communicable diseases has increased due to stagnant flood water, decreased access to clean water due to the floods, as well as over-crowding in collective centres. Health partners have reported an increase of malaria cases in many affected areas. Other major health risks include: cholera, acute watery diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea, vector-borne diseases including malaria and dengue as well as other epidemic- prone diseases such as measles malnutrition and.",

In north-east Nigeria, the low rates of immunisation within the population that are internally displaced have created conditions ideal for the transmission of measles. Additionally, in South Sudan ten counties have ongoing measles outbreaks although the reported leading cause of morbidity is currently malaria. It is key that reactive measles vaccination campaigns continue to be undertaken in a timely manner to reach the highest possible coverage in order to bring these outbreaks to a close.  \n\nIn recent weeks the number of new cases of Ebola virus disease has increased although the geographic spread of the disease continues to be limited to two provinces and the disease not spread to neighbouring countries. On 12 April 2019, the WHO Director General convened a meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee for Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee concluded that the ongoing outbreak does not constitute a PHEIC. However, the committee expressed their deep concern about the recent increase in transmission in specific areas, and the potential risk of spread to neighbouring countries and, therefore provided public health advice.",

A few days ago, as part of the COSACA consortium and in partnership with local organisation CECOHAS, Oxfam travelled to Gentivo in Zamb\u00e9zia Province, which was hit by heavy flooding in early March as the storm first made its way over land. The team found some 2,000 people in Gentivo in need of assistance, with an estimated 4,000 more remaining without access. Up to that point, the community were surviving off dates, coconuts and a few small fish they could catch, according to [Oxfam](https://reliefweb.int/node/3082753). Likewise, in Manica Province, some areas, particularly Mossurize and Sussundenga districts, are still difficult to reach and several communities in the Chefe de Posto Administrativo in Domb\u00e9, report being cut-off.",

In addition, the number of schools impacted by the cyclone had increased to more than 3,500, affecting approximately 335,100 students, according to the GRM.\n\n- The GRM Ministry of Health (MoH) had reported more than 4,660 cholera cases, including seven cholera-related deaths, in Sofala\u2019s Beira and Dondo towns and Buzi and Nhamatanda districts as of April 12. Health agencies completed a cholera vaccination campaign on April 10, reaching more than 803,100 people.\n\n- As of April 9, Tropical Cyclone Idai had resulted in 344 deaths and displaced more than 59,100 people in Zimbabwe, according to international media and relief agencies.  \nFlooding and winds related to the cyclone also severely damaged water and sanitation systems in a refugee camp in Chipinge District.\n\n- USAID recently provided more than $3.5 million to the UN World Food Program (WFP), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and CARE to support the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in Malawi affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai. WFP plans to distribute cash transfers for the purchase of food to approximately 205,000 individuals in internally displaced person (IDP) camps and cyclone-affected communities for two months, while CRS and CARE are supporting agriculture recovery activities in affected areas.",

    "title": "Tropical Cyclone Idai Flash Update, 10 April 2019",
    "body": "**Situation Overview**\n\nOn 14 March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai pummelled through south-eastern Africa to become one of the deadliest storms recorded to hit Southern Hemisphere. The cyclone caused catastrophic flooding, landslides and large number of casualties across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.  \n\nThe death toll in Mozambique, the hardest hit by the cyclone, stands at over 600 people with more than 1,600 people injured according to the local authorities. Nearly 240,000 houses have been damaged; over 111,000 totally destroyed. At least 161,000 people are staying in 164 sites in Manica (43), Sofala (113), Tete (5) and Zambezia (3). Numbers are likely to increase in the coming days. There are serious public health concerns related to the spread of cholera and other water-borne diseases. The Ministry of Health has registered over 3,160 cholera cases, with the majority in Beira. Approximately 1.8 million people are in need of assistance.  \nFood, shelter, relief items and medical assistance, including cholera vaccinations, are most urgently needed. There is an elevated risk of gender-based violence and abuse as people with specific needs, including non-accompanied children, women headed households, people living with disabilities and elderly, are coping with the aftermath of the disaster.  \n\nIn Malawi, nearly 870,000 people have been affected, over 730,000 are in urgent need of food and shelter and some 87,000 people have been displaced from their homes. More than 170 makeshift camps have been set up to host the affected population. In addition, about 6,000 Mozambican nationals have been forced to seek safety in Nsanje District, which is one of the hardest hit areas in Malawi. Mozambicans are currently staying in Bangula and Nyachilenda sites, which are also hosting Malawians affected.  \n\nOn 16 March 2019, eastern Zimbabwe was hit with heavy rains and strong winds causing riverine and flash flooding. The local authorities have reported over 340 deaths, 175 injured and 257 missing people.  Overall, over 270,000 people have been affected, 122,000 in Chipinge and 115,000 in Chimanimani Districts. At least 16,000 households are in need of shelter assistance in Bikita, Buhera, Chimanimani, Chipinge, Chiredzi, Gutu and Mutare Districts according to the local authorities. Approximately 5,300 refugees and asylum-seekers living in Tongogara Refugee Camp have also been severely impacted with 1,200 houses, latrines and water boreholes being completely or partially damaged.\n\n**UNHCR\u2019s Initial Response**\n\nAs UNHCR was already implementing refugee operations in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, the Office was able to join the collective UN system wide response in all the three countries promptly. UNHCR swiftly airlifted approximately 240 MT of shelter and relief items from global stockpiles to the three countries affected to assist initially some 30,000 most vulnerable cyclone survivors. In particular, family tents and plastic tarpaulins were delivered to shelter those who had lost their homes, mosquito nets to protect from malaria, jerry cans and water buckets to store clean water to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases, solar lanterns to provide light during the night and to recharge mobile phones, as well as sleeping mats and blankets to keep warm. Cooking sets to prepare food were provided by WFP and other partners. \n\nIn Mozambique, UNHCR is distributing relief items in informal sites around Beira in close coordination with local authorities and other partners. In Malawi, relief items have been transported to Blantyre and are being distributed mainly in Chikwawa, Nsanje and Phalombe Districts for both Malawian and Mozambicans. In Zimbabwe, relief items stored in Chipinge District are being distributed to affected Zimbabweans as well as to refugees and asylum-seekers in Tongogara refugee camp by UNHCR\u2019s NGO partner, GOAL.  \nUNHCR airlifted additional shelter and core relief items to some 5,300 refugees and asylum-seekers in Tongogara refugee camp, in Zimbabwe. \n\nUNHCR has also deployed emergency teams, consisting primarily of protection staff, to the three affected countries to support the response as well as to lead the Protection Clusters that have been activated by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to protect people with specific needs coping with the aftermath of the disaster. UNHCR is particularly concerned about the safety and well-being of women and girls, unaccompanied or separated minors, disabled and elderly people living in overcrowded conditions in multiple makeshift displacement sites. Many female-headed households are also facing heightened risk of exploitation and abuse as their sources of income and livelihoods were destroyed by the cyclone.  \n\nUNHCR is coordinating closely with the authorities and partners, including UNICEF and UNFPA, to ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout the response, including through preventing and responding to genderbased violence as well as sexual exploitation and abuse. In Mozambique and Zimbabwe, some people have also reportedly lost their identity documents when their homes were destroyed or damaged by heavy winds and flooding. As protection cluster (co) leads, UNHCR is working closely with relevant authorities and partners to assess the situation and provide the support needed by the three Governments.",

    "title": "Rapid Risk Assessment: Cyclone Idai - risk of communicable diseases in southern Africa",
    "body": "**Main conclusions and options for response**\n\nIn the aftermath of Cyclone Idai (mid-March 2019), the most immediate risks in the affected areas of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi are related to the increased transmission of diarrhoeal diseases due to lack of access to safe drinking water and poor sanitary conditions. In addition, the number of acute respiratory infections in children accommodated in overcrowded shelters has gone up. The risk of a major upsurge in cholera cases in affected areas or in bordering areas with previous transmission and flood-specific risks (e.g. tetanus and leptospirosis) should be considered a priority when adopting mitigating measures.  \n\nMozambique reported the first cholera cases a few days after the cyclone in Sofala province, mainly in the provincial capital Beira, with more than 3 500 cases being reported to date. International response support from ministries of health, United Nations organisations, and non-governmental organisations is ongoing. This includes the implementation of cholera treatment centres in Mozambique.  \n\nMosquito-borne diseases represent a risk that should also be taken into account in this context. In the affected areas in Mozambique and Malawi, malaria is endemic, with moderate seasonality. In these countries \u2013 while the main risk of malaria is due to disruption of the health services \u2013 an epidemic is not expected because of the presumed high levels of acquired immunity in the population. In Zimbabwe, where malaria prevalence and hence immunity levels are much lower, the risk of a malaria epidemic, or an extended malaria season (peak is normally between February and May) is larger.  \n\nSurveillance of infectious diseases in the aftermath of a cyclone is important for the early detection and confirmation of outbreaks. Consideration should be given to setting up a syndromic surveillance alert system if there is a need to reinforce surveillance capacity. Laboratory capacity should be assessed for confirming outbreaks of infectious diseases; if required, a referral mechanism can be established for testing samples of epidemic-prone diseases.  \n\nMeasures to address the potential disruption of national routine vaccination programmes, particularly those for infants, should be considered as part of basic emergency healthcare services.  \nAn assessment of HIV and tuberculosis treatment services should be considered and, where the treatment programme is disrupted, measures should be considered to ensure continuation of treatment.  \n\nThe overall risk for EU travellers or residents in affected countries is very low if proper personal prevention measures are taken.  \n\nThe prevention of gastrointestinal illnesses is dependent on adequate sanitation, availability of safe drinking water (chlorinated or boiled), and appropriate good food and hand hygiene, i.e. regularly washing hands with soap, eating thoroughly cooked food, washing fruits and vegetables with bottled or chlorinated water, and avoiding consumption of raw seafood products.",

Most of these people are staying with hosts in the extended community.\n\n\u2022 Revised Flash Appeal requires US$294 million to respond to the drought and Cyclone Idai.\n\n\u2022 Food Cluster partners have so far assisted an estimated 30,000 people in the worst-affected areas of Chimanimani and Chipinge.\n\n\u2022 Access to a sufficient quantity of water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene has been restored for 43,000 people.\n\n\u2022 Eight clusters have been activated to bolster the humanitarian response effort in support to the Government of Zimbabwe,\n\n270K affected people \n\n$60M Cyclone Idai requirements \n\n>4,000 households displaced \n\n299 deaths \n\n43,000 people have restored access to clean water\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW** \n\n\u2022 Following the landfall of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique on 14 March, eastern provinces of Zimbabwe experienced torrential rainfall. The combination of high winds and heavy rain in the districts of Chimanimani, Chipinge, Buhera, Nyanga, Makoni, Mutare Rural, Bikita, Masvingo and Gutu caused riverine and flash flooding, as well as landslides, causing significant loss of life, injury and displacement.\n\n\u2022 At least 299 deaths and 186 injuries have been reported, and 329 people were reported missing as of 3 April, according to the government. The international community with operational partners are finalizing targeting and distribution planning, and multi-sectoral support is being delivered. Temporary repairs have been completed on roads and bridges to Chimanimani town and most other cut-off areas; access is open for relief transports to all but three wards. However, the temporary repairs may be fragile and may not withstand heavy traffic or more torrential rain.\n\n\u2022 The homes of at least 4,000 households are destroyed or currently uninhabitable. This is expected to increase as Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessments are finalized. The vast majority are finding emergency accommodation with hosts in the extended community. Households hosting displaced people will require support to continue accommodating them until other permanent or temporary shelter solutions are on line. In the seven districts affected by the Cyclone Idai\u2014Chipinge, Chimanimani, Buhera, Bikita, Mutare, Gutu, and Chiredzi\u2014multisectoral support will be required to mitigate immediate risk, speed recovery and re-build livelihoods. The livelihoods of over 270,000 people across these districts has been affected; those in Chipinge and Chimanimani districts are worst hit.\n\n\u2022 This Situation Report takes into account the progress with the humanitarian response as it continues to gain momentum. The improved access affords a more detailed requirement of need after recent sectoral assessments. Sector-specific response, needs and gaps have been updated accordingly.",

    "body": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nSince the beginning of March 2019, Malawi has experienced floods and sustained heavy rains caused by the tropical cyclone Idai weather system. From 1 \u2014 6 April 2019 IOM, in close coordination with the Government of Malawi through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), conducted DTM Round II multi-sectoral location assessments in 103 displacement sites in Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe, Zomba districts. \n\n**DEMOGRAPHICS**\n\nDuring the reporting period 110,110 individuals (24,887 households) were recorded across 103 displacement sites.  \nAn additional 40 sites in the 4 districts were assessed and verified in this data collection round.  \nThe total displaced population is composed of 58% females and 42% males. Observing Figure 1, subdivided by age and sex, largest cohort is 18-59 years (27% female and 18% male), followed by 6-12 years (9% female, 7% male), and 13-17 years (9% female, 7% male). Children under 18 make up to 50% of the IDP population and 18% of them are under five years old (the average household size is 4.4).  \nIn 32 sites the majority of IDPs indicated that they are displaced from Chikwawa district. In 27 sites the majority of IDPs were from Nsanje. In 20 sites most IDPs are from Phalombe, while in the remaining 24 sites most IDPs are from Zomba. All the sites had a majority of IDPs from the same district as they were located (e.g. all the site in Chikwawa have a majority of IDPs from Chikwawa).  \nAn estimated 126 Mozambican households (349 individuals in total) were identified in one site in Nsanje district.\n\n**SITE INFORMATION**\n\nAll the displacement sites that were assessed are classified as collective centres. 53 of the displacement sites are schools, 16 are community centres, with the remaining 34 being classified as other. 38 sites reported having a site management agency, and the remaining 65 reported no agency. All the sites are reported to be accessible. \n\n**RETURN INTENTIONS**\n\nIn 52 of the 103 sites the majority of IDPs expected to be displaced between 1 and 3 months, while in 46 sites, IDPs expected to be displaced for more than 3 months.  \nFive (5) sites expect their overall displacement to be one month or shorter.  \nIn 74 of 103 sites it was reported that damaged/destroyed housing is the primary reason preventing people from returning to their area of origin. The remaining reasons reported are basic infrastructure damage (25), and lack of food (4).",

An estimated 1.85 million people across Mozambique have been affected, according to the UN. As of 06 April, 602 people are confirmed dead and 1,641 injured according to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC). 239,682 houses were identified by authorities as totally destroyed (111,163), partially destroyed (112,735) or flooded (15,784). This number is anticipated to rapidly expand as flood waters recede.  \n\nMore than 160,927 displaced people are sheltering in 164 sites across Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete. A World Bank commissioned rapid remote assessment to estimate the financial impacts of Cyclone Idai suggests as much as USD 773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture.  \n\nOn 07 April, the Ministry of Health confirmed 2,454 cases of cholera including 6 deaths. Most of the cases reported have been in Beira, followed by Nhamatanda and Dondo. A weeklong cholera vaccination campaign commenced on 03 April with and over 400,000 people have been vaccinated to date. 11 Cholera Treatment Centres have been established by health cluster partners and government in response. IOM\u2019s emergency health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programming experts are being deployed from across the region to Mozambique in order to support these urgent concerns. \n \nIOM\u2019s main office in Maputo is coordinating response activities with sub-offices in Tete and Beira to support the emergency response. In addition, IOM is deploying over 30 international technical experts on Shelter, Camp Management, Health, Protection, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and Early Recovery to enhance response capacity and initiate new activities.  \n\nIOM is co-leading the Shelter-NFI cluster with IFRC and leading on Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) related issues alongside Government counterparts.  \nIn order to respond to the humanitarian needs of 1.85 million people affected by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, IOM is appealing for USD 36.4 million for its emergency response for the next six months to September 2019. The UN is urgently seeking an additional USD 282 million of relief aid over the next three months to 30 June 2019. As of 08 April, the Humanitarian Response Plan is funded at USD 68.1M, 20.2% of funding requirements of USD 337M.",

    "body": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai made landfall during the night of 14th to 15th March 2019 along the coast of Dondo district (nearby the city of Beira) in the Province of Sofala, in central Mozambique.. The cyclone had heavy impacts on the city of Dondo as reported in the Initial Rapid Assessment Report, published on 25 March. The focus of this assessment was on relatively inaccessible coastal areas which had received minimal response and had not yet been properly assessed.  \n\nDondo distict is within Sofala province and has a population close to 185,000 according to the 2017 census (Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica, 2017). The extent of the damage across the district is currently being compiled and a district profile will be released on Friday 12 April.  \n\nA rapid assessment team made up of Cruz Vermellha de Mocambique (CVM) volunteers, IFRC logistics and assessment experts and the INGC Assessment Coordinator conducted the assessment in two locations. 2 interviews were conducted with local leaders using the inter-agency Mozambique Rapid Assessment form. The first was an interview with a community leader of Chinamacondo, providing an overview of the eastern part of the district. The second was with a community health worker in a small fishing community in Sengo. Transportation was by helicopter so aerial assessment could also be conducted of the arterial transportation routes and conditions on the coastline.",

    "body": "**BACKGROUND**\n\n**On 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique bringing devastation to the port City of Beira and surrounding areas**. The following weekend, the weather system swept more through additional areas of the central region, causing massive flooding and leaving entire swathes of the country submerged under 10 metres of water.\n\n**In the aftermath of the storm, there was an inspiring and instant outpouring of international support and solidarity**. More than 14 countries, including 5 from Africa, deployed over 100 assets to support the aid effort, and relief supplies were flown in from around the world. Civil Protection mechanisms were activated and Emergency Medical Teams were deployed. Donors triggered crisis mechanisms and the Emergency Relief Coordinator allocated $14 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), enabling humanitarian actors to rapidly scale-up operations.  \nAid organisations pre-financed more than $55 million for the response using internal funds that must now be repaid.\n\n**The incredible generosity of the international community has enabled the Government of Mozambique and aid agencies to reach more than 750,000 people with food assistance, vaccinate more than 745,000 people against cholera, deliver shelter and non-food items to more than 100,000 people, engage even the most remote communities on issues such as prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, establish clear referral pathways and services for survivors of gender-based violence, and so much more.\n\n**One month on, the humanitarian situation remains critical**. Hundreds of thousands of people who have lost everything require external assistance to survive: hundreds of hectares of crops have been lost; disease outbreaks (malaria and cholera) are not yet under control; over 160,000 people remain in accommodation sites; and basic services have not yet been fully re-established.\n\n**Yet, resources are running out.** The response to Cyclone Idai is just 21.4 per cent funded, with $60.4 million received out of $282 million requested. Although there are some resources in the pipeline, more are urgently needed to prevent the situation unravelling and allow the response to scale up and reach those most in need. Aid agencies are therefore calling on the international community to dig deep and urgently find additional funds to support the life-saving response. Unearmarked flexible financing will allow agencies to work most efficiently \u2013 to target the most critical needs and plug the most urgent gaps. Early action now will save considerable resources in the longer term. The medium term recovery and reconstruction effort \u2013 which is absolutely vital \u2013 will be made much more difficult if we are not able to stabilise the situation now.",

This brings the number of cases of cholera recorded in Malawi in 2019 to a total of nine of which three have been registered after the March floods.\n\n- UNICEF has provided safe water to 53,334 people and sanitation facilities to 51,691 people.\n\n- For the lean season response, the 27 food insecure districts will require support up to mid-April 2019, instead of the end of March as initially planned due. Continuous rains and flooding impeded the implementation of the programme in some areas, leading to delays.\n\n- A post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) is underway to determine recovery and reconstruction needs in areas affected by floods as well as build resilience of communities, systems and infrastructure\n\n- UNICEF has received US$6.3 million for the overall humanitarian response in 2019, however, funding a gap of US $9,83million (64 per cent) remains. For the floods response, out of the required US$8.23 million a funding gap of US $6.34 million (77 per cent) remains as of the reporting date. UNICEF continues to mobilize funding to be able to respond effectively to the needs of the affected population. \n\n**SITUATION IN NUMBERS** \n\n**3.3 million** People in need in need of urgent humanitarian support \n\n**497,548** Children under the age of 18 affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**975,584** People affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**About 100,000** People displaced \n\n**219,195 children** Targeted by UNICEF \n\n**UNICEF HAC Appeal US$ 15.3 million** of which flood response requirement is US$ 8.3 million* \n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs** \n\nThe 2018 Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) Annual Assessment, projected that 3.3 million people (661, 281 households) to be at risk of food insecurity in 27 out of 28 districts. MVAC recommended the provision of food assistance to start from October 2018 to March, 2019 across the 27 districts depending on severity of the food situation. The Government through Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), district councils and partners have been providing relief maize to the food insecure households. As at 03 April 2019, a total of 657,261 families had received maize. Food distribution has been completed in eight districts (Dedza, Karonga Kasungu Lilongwe, Mchinji, Ntcheu, Ntchisi Salima). In addition, complimentary top up cash transfers have been provided in some districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Chiradzulu, Machinga, Mwanza, Mchinji, Nkhotakota, Nsanje, Phalombe, Salima, and Zomba). Flooding has made some of the roads impassable, therefore, delaying the food distribution as well as prepositioning in some of the sites. The programme will continue with distribution of double rations in selected districts to expedite implementation and complete the exercise by mid-April.1 Food needs were exacerbated in early March, when a severe weather system hit Malawi with heavy rain accompanied by strong winds. This moved to Mozambique, where it intensified into Cyclone Idai. Most of the flood affected areas are within the same geographical area and target population as those locations with pre-existing food insecurity.  \n\nThe Government of Malawi declared a disaster on 8 March 2019 in the areas affected by the flooding and subsequently launched a three-month flood response plan, appealing for US$45 million, to reach 162,240 families, including over 85,000 displaced people in various sites. This is for immediate lifesaving aid and to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and malaria. By 30 March, the number of affected families had reached 216,796 (975,584 people) with 22,162 families (99,728 people) forced to leave their flood, damaged homes. The displaced have sought temporary shelter in 202 sites. The registered death toll is 59, while 727 people are reportedly injured. It is anticipated that food insecurity and malnutrition will be more pronounced as families return home due to the destruction of crops in the floods.  \n\nIn those areas affected by the floods, there is an elevated risk of disease outbreaks due to stagnant water conditions, overcrowding in IDP camps, inadequate access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health care.  \n\nOn 29 March, a patient tested positive for cholera at Mwanza district hospital. The patient, a Malawian, came from Mozambique. This brings the number of cases of cholera recorded in Malawi in 2019 to a total of nine of which three have been registered after the flooding event (one in flood affected Nsanje district and two in Mchinji district which is not among the flood affected districts).  \nThe Government is undertaking a PDNA in the areas impacted by the floods to determine recovery and reconstruction needs. The early-recovery cluster has been activated. With technical and financial support from a tripartite agreement between World bank, the UN and EU, the PDNA exercise started with an orientation session on 4 April and is expected to be completed by mid-April. All 15 districts and two cities affected by the floods will be included in the assessment with the level of detail being dependent on the degree of impact. The exercise will involve analysis of the effects (damage and losses), the impact (macroeconomic and human) and the estimation of recovery and reconstruction needs of the floods on key social, productive and infrastructure sectors.",

    "body": "This Weekly Bulletin focuses on selected acute public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 67 events in the region. This week\u2019s edition covers key new and ongoing events, including:  \n\nEbola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Cyclone Idai in Southern Africa (Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi)  \n\nHumanitarian crisis in Cameroon Humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia.  \n\nFor each of these events, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided.  \n\nA table at the end of the bulletin gives detailed information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have been controlled and thus closed.  \n\n**Major issues and challenges include:**\n\nThe impact of the destruction caused by cyclone Idai in Southern Africa is still unfolding as more areas become accessible by road. So far, the situation remains disastrous in most of the affected areas as the number of affected people by the cyclone and resulting disease outbreaks is growing. \n\nThe resulting poor access to communication networks is limiting the surveillance of diseases as well as information outside the epicenter of the event. In addition to the provision of basic needs such as food, clean water and shelter, setting up of the early warning component of the surveillance system due to the increased risk of vector and mosquito borne epidemic prone diseases is crucial at this stage. This will enable the early detection of potential outbreaks and ensuing appropriate and timely response. Moreover, the restoration of healthcare services can provide urgently needed trauma care, psychosocial counselling, maternal and child health services and treatment of common and chronic illnesses.  \n\nThe Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. During the reporting week, the late confirmation of another healthcare worker highlights the need to continue to strengthen infection and prevention control (IPC) measures as well as risk communication.  \n\nCommunity engagement to address persisting community concerns and mistrust are of paramount importance to assist in the response efforts to limit disease transmission. Despite the insecurity, the response teams continue to be fully operational in all outbreak affected areas. Continued support from the international community is required to ensure the outbreak comes to an end.",

Jointly with UNFPA, UNHCR, PLAN, Save the Children International, UNICEF developed an orientation curriculum on child protection, gender based violence (GBV), PSEA and trained 127 volunteers in Beira, with trainings currently ongoing in Chimoio\n\n- UNICEF and COSACA consortium are setting up temporary learning spaces benefitting 2,640 children in accommodation centres in the districts of Beira and Dondo.\n\n**SITUATION IN NUMBERS**\n\n**1.85 million** People in need by the cyclone/floods defined by HRP 2019\n\n**1 million** Children in need by the cyclone/floods\n\n**500,000** Children targeted through humanitarian interventions by UNICEF\n\n**965,000** People targeted through humanitarian interventions by UNICEF\n\n**2,772** Cholera cases reported in Sofala Province\n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs**\n\nThe Ministry of Health launched a cholera vaccination campaign on 03 April in the areas affected by the cyclone. The campaign is covering Beira city and other districts including Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi. The vaccination campaign is being carried out in accommodation centres, health units and mobile units with 884,000 people expected to be vaccinated.  \n\nAs of 6 April, there were 2,772 cholera cases recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and death toll of 05 people.Most of the cases have been reported in Beira (2,188 cases), followed by Nhamatanda (271 cases), and Dondo (289). On 04 April, the health authorities confirmed new cases of cholera in Buzi distric,t with 24 cases by 06 April. The cholera taskforce is holding daily meetings in Beira to inform operational response and community sensitization is on-going on radio and through printed communication materials to convey messages related to communicable disease control and when to seek health-care. There are 14 cholera treatment centres (CTC) in Sofala \u2013 eight in Beira city, three in Nhamatanda and the remaining in Dondo and Buzi.  \n\nThe Ministry of Health through the National Institute of Health and partners continue collecting samples of water sources in cholera affected areas and together with other line ministries carry out measures on sanitation, education, community mobilisation, and water trucking and distribution of CERTEZA.  \n\nAccording to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), at least 1,514,445 people were affected by the cyclone and floods in the central region of the country and the death toll has risen to 602. Reportedly, at least 223,898 houses were partially or totally destroyed.  \n\nAs of 07 April, 142,327 people have been displaced due to the cyclone and flooding. The displaced people are largely hosted in 139 transit centres in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces. The largest number of transit centres are in Sofala where at least 121,322 people are hosted in 111 centres. From 1 \u2013 5 April the Government closed at least 17 transit centres, most of them in Zambezia and Sofala provinces relocating about 4,142 people to new locations. In some cases families have been assigned land plots. According to INGC at least 263,181 students are affected by the floods and cyclones due to the damage of 3,359 classrooms in Sofala, Manica,  \nZambezia and Tete provinces. At least 54 health facilities are affected in Sofala, Manica and Zamb\u00e9zia.  \n\nAccess by road remains a challenge in several areas. Preliminary reports from a joint Government-inter-agency mission from Vilankulos to Sofala Province indicate that Chibabava is accessible by road and surrounding remote areas remain accessible by air only. There are five collective centres in Chibabava, only one of which (Xinhika) is reachable by road. The rest (Goonda Madjaca (403 households), Gerome (375 households), Xinhica Mudava (142 households), Xiquaxa (93 households) and Escola Secundaria File Jacnto Nyusse (09 households) are not reachable by road but have received some assistance by air from Beira. The Buzi district, the most flood affected area, is now accessible by road. However, Buzi north remains difficult to access but accessibility is expected to improve as repairs continues.",

    "body": "*This report is produced jointly by the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) of Malawi and the United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator in Malawi, in collaboration with humanitarian and development partners. It covers the period 23 March \u2013 7 April 2019. The next report will be issued on or around 20 April 2019.* \n\n**Highlights**\n\n \u2022 Relief assistance has been deployed to affected districts. 12 UN agencies with over 90 partners have assisted over 90,000 households, affected by the floods \u2022 Surge support has arrived in-country to support critical sectors, including shelter and displacement tracking, protection, coordination, early recovery and logistics.\n\n\u2022 Emergency Operations Centres were established in Lilongwe and Blantyre to better support and coordinate the on-going response.\n\n\u2022 A Flood Response Plan targeting all activated clusters was launched by the government and its partners on 28 March, 2019. Total requirements are US$45.2 million. Contributions and pledges amount to US$19.6million, leaving a gap of US$25.6million.\n\n\u2022 An application to the CERF to complement on-going response efforts was submitted. Total amount requested is US$3.3 million.\n\n\u2022 A Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) will be conducted from 8 April after which a report with early recovery needs will be shared.  \nAffected districts\n\n868,895 Affected throughout the country\n\n731,879 People in need\n\n86,976 People displaced in IDP camps\n\n90,000 Households reached with relief assistance Partners providing relief assistance\n\nSituation Overview Following the declaration by the Government of Malawi of the State of Disaster on 8 March, an appeal for support from local and international organisations was made. This triggered response operations aimed at meeting the immediate and life-saving needs of affected people. So far, support has continued to be received from various local and international partners. A total of 12 UN agencies and 90 partners have assisted approximately 90,000 people have been reached with various types of assistance including food,  \nWaSH, health, nutrition, shelter and protection. Flood waters have generally receded but approximately 70% of the affected population are still in camps. This is mainly because houses collapsed completely or were weakened and therefore remain a potential threat. As the response in ongoing to fill the critical gaps in food and shelter NFIs, mosquito nets and reproductive kits, governement and partners are discussiong early recovery options and packages (including seeds) for those households returing to their homes. All areas are now accessible, albeit some isolated pockets remain hard to reach. DoDMA estimates that these areas host approximately 5% of the affected population that is yet to receive assistance. Such areas include Chingale in Zomba district and the Food Security and Logistics Clusters are working together with DoDMA to reach these areas.  \nThe HCT met on 5 April to review the progress on the flood response. The meeting noted tremendous support from partners in responding to the floods but inadequate coordination mainly at district level.  \nInstitutions with capacity to support districts with Information Management (IM) support were encouraged to deploy this capacity to the districts. DoDMA will also deploy staff to key affected districts to boost coordination and information management. Surge support arrived in-country to support critical sectors, including shelter and displacement tracking (IOM), protection (UNHCR), coordination (OCHA), early recovery (UNDP) and logistics (WFP).  \nThe government, through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs launched a Flood Response Plan on 28 March, 2019. Total funding requirements for immediate assistance (March to May 2019) are US$45.2million. Contributions and pledges made so far total from donors, government, bilateral agreements and internal agency arrangements are US$19.3 million, leaving a gap of US$25.6 million. The plan seeks to support response and recovery interventions around Coordination, Food Security,  \nAgriculture, Nutrition, Protection, WASH, Education, Health, Shelter and Camp Management, and Early Recovery. The Plan was developed under the leadership of DoDMA with support from UN partners and civil society organisations. An application to the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to complement on-going response efforts was submitted. Total amount requested is US$3.3 million to support prioritised activities in food, health, nutrition, protection, education, shelter/NFIs and logistics. \n\nAn application to the Central Emergency Response Fund of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to complement on-going response efforts has been submitted. Total amount requested is US$3.2 million to support prioritised activities in the following clusters: Food, health, nutrition, protection, shelter/NFIs and logistics. \n\nThe humanitarian response needs to focus on meeting urgent yet diverse needs of affected women - including pregnant and lactating mothers - girls, boys and men, adolescents and youths, the elderly, and people with disabilities, while also protecting them from violence, abuses and exploitation, while maintaining their dignity. To best inform response programming, there is an urgent need to establish gender/age disaggregated data and to apply an age-gender-diversity mainstreaming tool across the clusters. \n\nCoordination and cluster meetings at national and regional level are being held although this needs to be strengthened. Regional meetings are also being held in Blantyre chaired by DoDMA and supported by WFP. However, coordination challenges at district level is affecting the efficacy of the response operations. \n\nMostly, clusters are not meeting regularly and most of the work is left for the Assistant District Disaster Management Officer who is already busy with overall coordination. There are plans to establish Emergency Operations Centres at regional level to better support response operations at district level.  \n\nA Post-Disaster Needs Assessment will be conducted in April. The objective of this assessment is to estimate the physical, economic and human impacts of the 2019 floods on the socio-economic development of the country at the national and district level. It also seeks to inform short, medium and long-term interventions to strengthen the GoM\u2019s recovery, reconstruction and resilience building systems.  \n\nAn Inter-agency Assessment Committee conducted a verification exercise in Machinga, Mangochi, Zomba and Balaka districts. A total of 357,078 people (80,152 households) were affected across the four districts out of a total population of 3,069,152 representing 11.6% with 4,562 households are displaced in various sites including schools, churches. Major impact was on infrastructure and on household items and crops.  \n\nThe findings also noted minimal protection services in sites which may place women and children vulnerable to abuse. Water and sanitation services were critically low putting pressure on inadequate toilets and water points in schools. Response has been triggered and food and NFIs have been provided by government and its partners. However, the supplies are inadequate considering that the displaced are likely to be in camps for a minimum of a month",

More than 93,700 people had been reached with some form of shelter and non-food item assistance as of 6 April.\n\n\u2022 Some 342 new cases of cholera were reported on 6 April, in Beira (220 cases), Nhamatanda (50 cases) and Dondo (54 cases) and Buzi (18 cases).\n\n\u2022 More than 429,100 people had received the Oral Cholera Vaccine as of 6 April, representing 51 per cent of the total targeted.\n\n\u2022 More than 668,600 people have received food assistance to date, including 10,000 people receiving ready-to-eat meals in Beira City.\n\n\u2022 Referral pathways have been established in Beira for survivors of gender-based violence.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nThe death toll rose to 602 people as at 6 April, according to government reports. The number of houses recorded as destroyed and damaged increased by nearly 23,000 from 5 April to 239,682, including 111,163 totally destroyed, 112,735 partially destroyed, and 15,784 flooded. Meanwhile, the number of internally displaced people living in collective sites was 142,327 as of 6 April, according to government figures. Beyond those sheltering in collective sites, many more displaced people are living within host communities and with family members.  \n\nThe situation in Buzi is particularly concerning. According to an inter-agency [Mozambique Rapid Assessment](https://reliefweb.int/node/3072233/), carried out in collaboration with the INGC, an estimated 75 per cent of settlements in Buzi province were flooded, with many homes flooded for seven days and much cropland still underwater after three weeks. Wind damage from the cyclone was extensive across the north of the district, and extensive destruction of crops and livestock has reduced food security. Health infrastructure was reportedly destroyed in Macarungo and Estaquinha and damaged in Vile cede Buzi, Chicoio and Barada, restricting access to essential healthcare. Contamination of water supplies and significant reduction in sanitation and hygiene practices were reported, and cases of acute watery diarrhoea were reported in all locations, except Macurungo.  Respondents reported malnutrition in six out of 10 locations. All locations reported malaria.\n\nSome 342 new cholera cases were recorded on 6 April, bringing the total number of registered cases to 2,772, according to the Ministry of Health. Beira recorded the majority of the new cases (220 cases recorded on 6 April), followed by Dondo (54 cases), Nhamatanda (50 cases) and Buzi (18 cases). At least 429,177 people were vaccinated as of 6 April, representing 51 per cent of people targeted. Malaria also remains a significant concern, with 412 cases recorded on 6 April alone. Malaria is endemic in many of the areas impacted by Cyclone Idai.",

Humanitarian partners continue to call for any relocations out of schools or elsewhere to be safe, dignified and voluntary. Key priority needs in the new accommodation sites include access to clean and safe drinking water, shelter materials and sanitation facilities. Psychosocial support and counseling for families who have lost loved ones and all their belongings, particularly men who are presenting with emotional instability, will continue to be needed both in the accommodation sites and places of return.",

This is twice the number of houses originally estimated in the appeal, leaving a significant gap.  \n\n- Distributions are in process with over 83,000 people assisted to date, 29,000 tarpaulins distributed.  \n\n- Partners are unable to deliver full household kits due to lack of items, in stock and in pipeline.  \nCurrent pipeline gap of 61,000 tarpaulins, based on original appeal target. This calculation may change with revised damage data.  \n\n- Distribution capacity is limited. The new focus is on quality of programming and Operational partners are urgently required to scale up ability to distribute emergency shelter and NFI.  \n\n- Airlift operations are scaling back and renewed focus is on ground transportation wherever possible.  \n\n- Road access is improving, markets are recovering and affected populations are beginning their own self recovery where they have land and capacity to do so, but many remain cut off from roads, or displaced in evacuation centres and unable to return.  \n\n- Active CCCM sub-cluster is working in relocation sites and transit camps to establish safe living spaces and to ensure that sites are habitable before schools and other collective centres are closed. \n\n**Overall situation analysis** \n\nCategory 4 cyclone Idai made landfall on 14/03/19. High winds damaged and destroyed houses and infrastructure, and the ensuing flooding caused major additional damage and displacement. Although waters are receding, over 15,000 houses remain flooded.  \n\nAs of 05/04/2019, The Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) damage data puts the total number of households damaged or destroyed at 103,537 partially destroyed, 97,424 totally destroyed, 15.784 flooded, or a total of 216,000 HH damaged / destroyed. Shelter damage assessment lead by the Government of Mozambique is ongoing.  \n\nBased on earlier estimates, the cluster is targeting 475,000 people in 87,500 households. This is based on 80,000 households targeted in the Flash appeal and 7,500 households in the Red Cross appeal.",

While recognizing the importance of children resuming education as rapidly as possible, there is continued advocacy for any relocations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from schools to be safe, dignified, voluntary and well-planned. \n\nAt least 130,000 people were sheltering in 129 sites across Manica (20), Sofala (101), Tete (5) and Zambezia (3) as of 4 April, a decrease of nearly 1,300 people from 3 April. Monitoring of IDP movements in the sites remains a challenge as identification documents are ordinarily not provided during registration. There are unconfirmed reports of people returning home from some of the sites. However, there are also reports of new arrivals in some sites. WASH partners are responding to concerns around the living conditions in return areas, as most places reportedly lack access to basic services, including clean drinking water and sanitation facilities. The Protection Cluster has reported that several men and women in the collective sites are presenting with signs of trauma, having lost all their property, and are in need of psychosocial support and counselling. The Government had identified nearly 28,000 people as vulnerable as of 4 April.  \n\nWhile more than 562,000 people have been reached by food assistance, food security remains a major concern in the long term, as more than 715,000 hectares of crops were reportedly damaged by the floods, according to the Government. The destruction of crops near harvest time has prolonged the 2018-2019 lean season and the likelihood of increased food insecurity in the period ahead.  \n\nThe total number of registered cholera cases stood at 2,094, including six cases reported from a new outbreak in Buzi town, in Sofala Province, as of 4 April. The Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) Campaign that started on 3 April was ongoing.",

    "body": "**Introduction** \n\nZimbabwe faced one of its greatest tragedies in the month of March. Following several forecasts of an approaching cyclone that was reported likely to affect Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, on 15 March Zimbabwe woke to a shockwave of devastation as Cyclone Idai engulfed parts of Manicaland, Masvingo, and Mashonaland East Provinces. A horrific trail of destruction caused by the Tropical Cyclone plunged communities of Chimanimani and Chipinge into tragedy with a death toll of above 280 and still counting, while more than 500 people are still missing and 54,000 households in dire need of food, clothing, shelter, water and sanitation services1 . Zimbabweans united across political, ethnic and geographical divide in solidarity to support victims and families affected by this tragedy.  \n\nThe cost of living rose sharply during the month leading to steep prices of basic commodities while the shortage of fuel exacerbated transport costs for commuters. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) conducted a by-election in Bulawayo, Cowdray Park (Ward 28) on 30 March to fill a vacancy that had arisen following the death of the incumbent Councillor, Hapson Ncube, who died in December 2018. The Zanu PF candidate Kidwell Mujuru was duly elected as Councillor, a seat which was previously won by the MDC-A during the 2018 harmonised elections. The MDC fielded two candidates for the post; a manifestation of the rifts existing in the party.  \n\nZPP recorded a total of 213 violations up from 196 recorded in February. The majority of violations reported and recorded were harassment, intimidation and threats, at approximately 52.6%. In Mashonaland Central and Mashonaland East provinces, some Zanu PF members and village heads forced community members to contribute towards Independence Day commemorations. In Mt Darwin North, Mukumbura wards 4 and 5, villagers were made to pay $3 RTGS per household and those who did not have money were asked to provide 2kgs of maize meal and an unspecified quantity of cooking oil. Discrimination constituted 16.9%, theft/looting 11.3%, assaults 8.9% and displacement 5.6 % of the total recorded violations.  \n\nThe province with the highest number of violations recorded in March is Mashonaland Central with a total of 56 cases followed by Manicaland with 34 cases. Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South and Bulawayo provinces recorded the lowest number of reported cases with a collective of 12 violations.",

    "body": "**A. Situation analysis**\n\n**Description of the disaster**\n\nWhile Zimbabwe was bracing for a big food insecurity emergency from an El-nino induced poor rainfall season, forecast was issued on 11 March 2019 of category 4 Tropical cyclone Idai developing off the Mozambican coast to affect most of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. By the 14th March 2019 the cyclone had made landfall in Mozambique, devastating Beira and the Sofala provinces as it headed towards eastern Zimbabwe. On 15th March, the cyclone made landfall in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe with heavy rains in access of 300mm and wind speeds of 177k/h. This had a devastating impact in Chimanimani, Chipinge and Mutare districts, the most affected being Rusitu area in Chimanimani. By the morning of 15 March, 20 people were feared dead, some missing and several houses were destroyed. The heavy precipitation and winds continued to pound the district and extended towards Nyanga, Mutare, Buhera districts of Manicaland Province. As of 27 March, 172 fatalities had been confirmed, 4,884 people displaced and 327 missing. According to preliminary reports, at least 53,999 people are believed to have been affected.\n\nExtensive damage to roads infrastructure has totally inhibited road access to most affected people, thus the extent of the need remains uncertain. Preliminary rescue and response efforts are underway being coordinated through the Department of Civil Protection. ZRCS has since deployed NFIs and response personnel to the affected areas. However, the extent of the need has overwhelmed the NS response stocks, thus flagging support from Red Cross Movement as well as launching a domestic appeal for assistance. The Meteorological Service has indicated that while the cyclone seems to be dissipating, heavy rains are expected to continue pounding the affected areas in the eastern parts of the of the country.\n\nThe extent of the devastation prompted the government to declare a State of Disaster on the 17th of March 2018, appealing for support for the response. Based on the preliminary report of a joint assessment by the Department of Civil protection (DCP), the Red Cross and other agencies, the most affected area is Chimanimani district particularly in areas such as Chimanimani Urban, Charleshood Farm, St Charles Lwanga Secondary School Machongwe, Vhimba Kopa Growth Point. Rivers bursting such as Haroni, Rusitu and Nyahode River have caused extensive damage to bridges, roads and completely inundated whole settlements, making it difficult for a thorough assessment to be done in the district. Landslides, including rock landslides, have occurred given the hilly and mountainous outlay of the area. Power has been disrupted along with water and sanitation facilities either damaged or flooded. The situation is dire, with an urgent need to provide tents, food and blankets for the affected people.\n\n**Summary of the current response**\n\n**Overview of Host National Society.**\n\nZimbabwe Red Cross Society has eight (8) provincial offices and a network of more than 20,000 volunteers countrywide. ZRCS has previous experience in implementing DREFs and emergency relief programs throughout the country, with support from various donor partners and Partner National Societies (PNS). In the past five months, ZRCS has implemented a Cholera response, partly supported by DREF and is currently implementing a drought relief programme supported by the Danish RC, Finnish RC and British RC in Kariba and Siakobvu while partnering with WFP in Muzarabani in a lean season food assistance programme. The Projects with British RC, Finnish RC, Danish RC are using cash as a modality. This experience coupled with numerous other multi-sectoral response operation is critical in delivering quality programming to the affected population. The NS has become a key partner for the National Civil Protection and will use the public good will and humanitarian space to ensure assistance reaches the affected population in time. The National Society already has existing capacities such as several RDRT, FACT and NDRT trained staff in WASH, Shelter, PSS, who will greatly enhance the efficacy of the planned response.\n\nZRCS has presence in all the affected districts but more strongly in Chipinge, where a resilience programme is currently running with support from the British RC. The network of trained volunteers is available to support the response to various needs such as First Aid, Shelter and Hygiene Promotion. In most inaccessible areas the volunteers have been reported to be leading the local rescue efforts as well as issuing Early Warning information to their communities.\n\nAt National level, the NS has since deployed 15 staff members to the affected areas to undertake detailed needs assessment, concurrently with distributions of NFIs for shelter, WASH, clothing and blankets. A medical team from the ZRCS clinic was also deployed to provide much needed emergency medical relief to the affected given the damage and interruption of medical facilities and services. This team has, to date, effectively delivered these services in Chimanimani, stabilising patients before being airlifted to referral hospitals. The NS has managed to maintain presence and visibility in all the three affected provinces whereas most of the relief agencies attention has been focused on Chimanimani even with obvious accessibility challenges. Shelter construction has been done in Masvingo along with NFI distributions reaching 50 households. This process is ongoing. This initial response has been enabled by the British RC, the Finnish RC and ZRCS\u2019s own resources. Joint assessments with the department of Civil Protection have been conducted in Mutare and Chipinge enabling preliminary information on the type and extent of needs on the ground to be available. Significant contributions have been received from many local companies and individuals after domestic appeals from the NS. Presently, 9.2 metric tonnes of food items have been received and conveyed to the affected population potentially reaching 200 people. This also included numerous donations of clothing and bedding articles which have also been received and are being sorted and transported to the affected areas.\n\nThere is an existing project partnership with WFP to provide food assistance in cyclone affected areas. As part of a joint two-phase project 100,000 people will be targeted with food in Chimanimani. The first phase aims to provide immediate assistance of high nutritious food for 2-3 weeks, which has already begun and is on-going. Phase 2 aims to provide three months support, with the details of the second phase still being developed.\n\nThis DREF is anticipated to support the replenishment of already used funds for the initial assessments, and replenishments of NFIs including, shelter kits, buckets, bars of soap, water guard already used. The ZRCS is also participating in coordination meetings at national, provincial and district level and will continue to collaborate with the DCP and the inter-agency assessment team on continuing assessments. This DREF will further enable ZRCS to expand its response operations once all the assessments are completed for areas currently inaccessible. Such assessments will give a clearer picture of the immediate and intermediate needs to which the NS must focus on.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nIn mid-March, Cyclone Idai crossed into southern Zimbabwe causing wide-scale flooding and destruction in the regions of Manicaland, Mashonaland East and Masvingo. Approximately 270,000 people were affected by the flooding and landslides when local rivers and their tributaries burst their banks, inundating homes and schools and causing considerable damage to property and livelihoods. The worst affected districts were Chipinge and Chimanimani in Manicaland which were cut-off due to severe damage to roads and bridges in the area. \n\nIn the aftermath of the cyclone, the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) declared a state of disaster and requested international assistance. The Department of Civil Protection, the country\u2019s national disaster management agency, is leading the response. WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has been requested by the Resident Coordinator (RC) to provide coordination and information management support, and to facilitate access to common logistics services to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas.\n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks**\n\nFlooding and landslides have caused significant damage to logistics infrastructure, particularly roads and bridges in the hardest hit areas, rendering these areas inaccessible by land. It is expected that given the extent of the damage, repairs to affected roads and bridges may take a considerable amount of time, and as such air transport is the only option for moving goods into affected areas.\n\nThe influx of relief items into Mutare, the designated logistics hub of the operation, requires an improved and additional logistics response capacity, as warehousing is not entirely in line with the responding organizations\u2019 requirements. As such, temporary storage such as Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) will be required to supplement capacity in some operational locations and ensure an uninterrupted supply chain.\n\nA delay in logistics coordination activities and reliable information sharing amongst the humanitarian community has impacted the operational decision-making of humanitarian organisations.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the major logistics constraints impacting humanitarian options in the most affected areas of Chimanimani and Chipinge are:\n\n- Inability to transport relief items to affected areas by road\n- Limited temporary storage capacity in Mutare airport for the adequate consolidation of incoming relief items prior to their air transport to the affected areas\n- Lack of consolidated logistics information and coordination of efforts",

    "body": "**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nOn March 14, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira in Mozambique. The cyclone moved across Mozambique and then inland, affecting parts of Malawi and Zimbabwe. The powerful storm brought widespread flooding and destruction. This is the most severe natural disaster to affect southern Africa in over three decades.\n\nMore than two weeks after the cyclone hit, communities are still searching for lost loved ones and are beginning to take stake of their losses. There are more than 800 confirmed fatalities, and that number is expected to increase as hundreds of people are still declared missing. There are currently 228,000 people being housed in crowded shelter camps, raising concerns among aid workers and government officials about the risk of disease outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with the government of Mozambique to provide cholera vaccinations, as there have already been 270 confirmed cases of the disease.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the hardest hit areas are the rural, agricultural communities of Chimanimani and Chipinge, which already suffer from high rates of poverty. More than 250,000 people were affected, many of whom lost their houses, livestock and crops . In the village of Copa, 300 houses were destroyed and dozens of people are still missing. Some affected villages are still inaccessible due to hazardous road conditions.\n\nBecause the floods occurred at the height of harvest season, thousands of people will need to rely on food aid for the next 6-9 months while they replant and recover their crops.\n\n**INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE EFFORTS**\n\nOn March 22, the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) for the United Nations declared Scale-Up level (formerly called Level 3) in Mozambique, declaring it the highest level of priority for UN Agencies. The International Red Cross is supporting search and rescue efforts through their local chapters and the governments of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The U.S. and several European countries have committed funding for humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the government is coordinating with several INGOs on food distribution and needs assessments. Civil protection units have been assigned to help coordinate the response but they have been largely overwhelmed by the need. Lutheran World Relief and IMA World Health has been active in humanitarian coordination clusters on the ground to assess the most pressing needs.",

At least 131,100 people were still sheltering in 136 sites across Manica (21); Sofala (107); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3) as of 3 April. The number of vulnerable people reported by the Government in the accommodation sites rose significantly by more than 20,000 people to 27,764 as of 3 April.\n\nThe number of houses destroyed rose by more than 86,000 from 2 April. More than 198,300 houses have been totally destroyed (85,265), partially destroyed (97,276) or flooded (15,784), with more than 715,000 hectares of crops reportedly destroyed, according to the Government. The destruction of crops near the main harvest time continues to raise concerns over food security prospects in the long-term.\n\nNearly 151,000 students of school going age have been affected, as more than 3,300 classrooms have been destroyed, damaged and/or occupied by displaced people. The number of accommodation sites in Zambezia reduced from 13 to 3 from 1 to 3 April, reflecting significant returns by people previously displaced, according to the authorities.\n\nAt least 1,741 cases of cholera and two deaths were reported as of 3 April, according to the Ministry of Health. The vast majority of cases reported have been reported in Beira (1,449 cases; 1 death), Dondo (134 cases; 1 death) and Nhamatanda (158 cases). The number of cases reported in Dondo doubled from 2 April (66 cases) to 3 April (134) cases. The Ministry of Health and partners are rapidly responding and implementing prevention and treatment.  \n\nAccess by road remains a challenge in several areas. Preliminary reports from a joint Government-inter-agency mission from Vilankulos to Sofala Province has reported that Chibabava is accessible by road, but the surrounding remote areas remain accessible by air only. There are five collective centres in Chibabava, only one of which (Xinhika) is reachable by road. The rest (Goonda Madjaca (403 households), Gerome (375 households), Xinhica Mudava (142 households), Xiquaxa (93 households) and Escola Secundaria File Jacnto Nyusse (9 households) are not reachable by road but have received some assistance by air from Beira.",

    "body": "UNHCR RESPONSE IN MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI AND ZIMBABWE \n\n**Situation Overview** \n\nTropical Cyclone Idai made landfall near Beira City in central **Mozambique** on 14 March 2019. Initial reports indicate over 500 deaths, 1,500 injured and significant damage to infrastructure in Beira and surrounding areas. Nearly 140,000 people are currently housed in some 155 informal sites across Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia Provinces. Some 8,700 refugees and asylum-seekers in Maratane refugee camp in Nampula Province have not been affected. \n\nIn **Malawi**, some 870,000 people have been affected, over 730,000 are in urgent need of food and relief items and over 87,000 people have been displaced from homes. More than 170 makeshift camps have been set up to host the affected population. In addition, more than 4,400 Mozambican nationals have been forced to seek safety in Nsanje District, which is one of the hardest hit areas in Malawi due to flooding. Dzaleka refugee camp in Dowa District hosting 37,000 refugees and asylum-seekers has not been affected.\n\nIn the Chimanimani and Chipinge Districts of **Zimbabwe**, high winds and heavy rains triggered riverine and flash flooding. At least 200 deaths have been reported by authorities. Over 270,000 people have been affected by the damage caused by the cyclone. Infrastructure, including schools, roads and bridges have been seriously impacted in Chimanimani District. Tongogara refugee camp hosting 13,000 refugees and asylum-seekers as well as neighbouring communities in Chipinge District have also been severely affected \u2013 many houses, latrines and water boreholes have been completely or partially damaged increasing the risk of disease. \n\n**UNHCR\u2019s Initial Response** \n\nTropical Cyclone Idai has caused extensive loss of life, large-scale destruction of infrastructure and a surge in humanitarian needs far exceeding the response capacities of governments and humanitarian actors. On 22 March 2019, the Emergency Relief Coordinator activated an IASC Humanitarian SystemWide Scale-Up in Mozambique for an initial period of three months. UNHCR joined the collective UN system response in all three countries. UNHCR\u2019s response will need to be scaled up significantly, therefore, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi activated UNHCR emergency procedures covering all three countries in order to facilitate the delivery of the Office\u2019s commitments under the IASC system-wide Scale-Up protocols. This allows UNHCR to take the necessary actions to scale up its operational capacity, including mobilizing and/or re-allocating human, financial, material and other relevant resources. The close involvement in the joint humanitarian response also demonstrates UNHCR\u2019s solidarity with the people in the region who have for decades generously hosted refugees and shared their limited resources with them. \n\nAs an initial response, UNHCR has airlifted shelter and relief items from global stockpiles to assist some 30,000 most vulnerable cyclone survivors in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe with family tents, plastic tarpaulins, sleeping mats, blankets, mosquito nets, solar lanterns, cooking sets, jerry cans, buckets and soap. UNHCR will also provide family tents and core relief items to 5,300 affected refugees and asylum-seekers in Tongogara refugee camp. \n\nThe first UNHCR relief flight from Dubai, carrying 84MT of relief items for 10,000 affected people, arrived in Maputo on 27 March 2019. Items were received by UNHCR Regional Director for Southern Africa, UNHCR Representative in Mozambique and government officials. Some 14MT of relief items have already been transported to Beira for distribution. On 30 March 2019, UNHCR\u2019s flight with 87MT of relief items for 10,000 people landed in Lilongwe, Malawi. Humanitarian aid was handed over to the Government of Malawi by UNHCR Representative in Malawi and transported to Blantyre for onward transmission to the affected districts of Chikwawa, Nsanje and Phalombe. Finally, on 31 March 2019, the third relief flight with 80MT of aid for 10,000 affected people reached Harare where it was received by UNHCR Representative in Zimbabwe accompanied by the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the UN Resident Coordinator. Relief items are being transported to Chipinge District for the distribution to the affected people.\n\nUNHCR has also deployed emergency teams, consisting primarily of protection staff, to the three affected countries to support the response as well as to lead the Protection Clusters that have been activated by the IASC to protect vulnerable people coping with the aftermath of the disaster. In cooperation with national authorities, the main focus will be to ensure protection is mainstreamed throughout the response, including through preventing and responding to gender-based violence (GBV) as well as sexual exploitation and abuse and protecting unaccompanied and separated minors in close cooperation with UNICEF and UNFPA. In Mozambique, UNHCR Senior Protection Coordinator is already leading the Protection Cluster in Beira, and separate sub-clusters for GVB and child protection have also been activated and led by UNFPA and UNICEF, respectively.",

So far, 5,346 children under-5 have been screened. Of these, 343 cases of severe or moderate acute malnutrition have been registered, with 281 referred for treatment.\n\n- To meet the urgent humanitarian needs, UNICEF is requesting US$8.26 million of which 68 per cent remains unfunded, to meet the needs of affected women and children affected by the flood. \n\n**SITUATION IN NUMBERS** \n\n**3.3 million** People in need in need of urgent humanitarian support \n\n**443,136** Children under the age of 18 affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**868,895** People affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**Over 85,000** People displaced \n\n**219,195 children** Targeted by UNICEF \n\n**UNICEF HAC Appeal US$ 15.3 million** of which flood response requirement is US$ 8.26 million* \n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs**    \n\nOver 3.3 million people are classified as in need of urgent humanitarian support due to consecutive poor harvests in Malawi. These needs were exacerbated in early in early March, when a severe weather system hit Malawi with heavy rain accompanied by strong windstorms. This moved to Mozambique, where it intensified into Cyclone Idai, and then hit Malawi a second time. The heavy and persistent rains caused severe flooding across districts in southern Malawi. A total of 868,900 people (an estimated 443,000 children) have been affected, including more than 86,980 displaced people, with 60 deaths and 672 injuries recorded according to the Government. In total, fifteen districts and two cities have been impacted. Approximately 174 schools are affected (flooded or occupied) in four districts (Chikwawa, Phalombe, Nsanje, and Zomba). Out of the 174 schools, 104 are occupied by internally displaced people (IDPs). This has resulted in overcrowded or nonoperational schools; affecting an estimated 77,174 students.    \n\nThe flood affected areas are the same geographical area and target population as those locations with high rates of food insecurity. Food insecurity and malnutrition will be more pronounced as families return home due to the majority of crops being wiped out from the flooding just before harvest season.    \n\nThe Government of Malawi has launched a three-month response plan, appealing for US$45 million, to reach 162,240 households, including over 85,000 displaced people in various sites. This requested assistance is for immediate lifesaving aid and to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and malaria.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nOn 27 March, IOM\u2019s Chief of Mission joined a UNICEF visit to affected areas with Graca Machel, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator and the UNICEF Regional Director to meet with senior government response leadership to review ongoing humanitarian operations. \n\nIOM has received and distributed in-kind shelter contributions and related equipment from UKAID, the Swiss Development Cooperation Agency, the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation and USAID over the past 2 weeks. \n\nIOM\u2019s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) teams carried out site assessments in 32 evacuation sites in Beira and surrounding areas (Sofala) in coordination with the Mozambique\u2019s National Institute of Disaster Management.\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in central Mozambique the night of 14 March 2019. An estimated 1.85 million people across Mozambique have been affected, according to the United Nations. More than 92,000 houses have been identified as totally destroyed (50,772), partially destroyed (25,769) or flooded (15,784)\u2013 numbers continue to rise with assessments ongoing.\n\nAs of 29 March, a total of 140,784 people (29,098 households) are accommodated in 161 sites across Sofala (116 sites), Manica (27 sites), Zambezia (13 sites) and Tete (5 sites) provinces. As of 29 March, 493 people are confirmed dead and 1,523 injured.\n\nIOM\u2019s main office in Maputo is coordinating response activities with a sub-office in Tete province. Following the impact of Cyclone Idai, IOM opened a new sub-office in Beira (Sofala) to support the emergency response. In addition, and as part of the scale-up, IOM is deploying an 30 international technical experts on Shelter, Camp Management, Health, Protection, Water,  \nSanitation and Hygiene and Early Recovery to enhance response capacity and initiate new activities.\n\nIOM is co-leading the Shelter-NFI cluster with IFRC and leading on CCCM-related issues alongside Government counterparts. IOM has long-standing partnerships with COSACA, CHEMO, and IFRC for emergency response activities and will focus its efforts on supporting shelter cluster partner activities along with scaling up its own response.\n\nFurther, on 29 March, the Ministry of Health confirmed 271 cases of cholera, and 2,500 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD), in what many fear may be the onset of a major outbreak of the disease. A cholera vaccination campaign is set to commence at the beginning of April and Cholera Treatment Centres are being established in response. IOM\u2019s emergency health and WASH programming experts are being deployed from across the region to Mozambique in order to support these urgent concerns.\n\nIn order to respond to the humanitarian needs of an estimated 1.85 million people affected by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, IOM is appealing for USD 36.4 million for its emergency response for the next six months. The United Nations is urgently seeking an additional USD 282 million of relief aid over the next three months to 30 June 2019.",

The weather system\u2019s impact was particularly devastating as it came in three waves: in early March, the low-pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March,  \nCyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira \u2013 home to 500,000 people -leaving death and destruction in its wake; and finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and a dam in Buzi district to burst, sweeping away entire communities and leaving an unknown number of people stranded. As a result of the triple effect of the impact of Cyclone Idai and subsequent flooding, an estimated 1.85 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.  \nAs of 2 April, the official death toll had risen to 598 people, an increase of 80 since 1 April; with more than 1,600 people injured, according to the Government. The death toll is expected to continue to rise as areas previously cut-off become reachable by road and the full extent of the damage becomes known.\n\nNearly 112,000 houses have been identified by the authorities as totally destroyed (62,153), partially destroyed (34,139) or flooded (15,784), leaving more than 131,000 people displaced in 136 sites across Sofala (109,199 people), Manica (14,047 people), Zambezia (5,235 people) and Tete (2,655 people) as of 2 April. There has been a significant decrease in the number of displacement sites in Zambezia province, from 13 to 3, as people begin to return home. Protection partners estimate that more than half of the affected people are children and the Government has registered more than 7,400 vulnerable people at the accommodation sites.  \n\nMore than 715,000 hectares of crops have been destroyed to date, raising concerns over food security, as the destruction occurred during the annual main harvest for the central region. Many people interviewed in collective sites by IOM have reported that, in addition to damaged or destroyed houses, lack of food and absence of livelihoods are among the primary concerns preventing people from returning.  \n\nThe humanitarian situation is compounded by a rising incidence of water-borne and vector-borne diseases in the affected districts. On 27 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) declared a cholera outbreak in Beira. As of 2 April, some 1,428 cases of cholera and two deaths had been reported in Beira (1,218 cases; 1 death), Dondo (66 cases; 1 death) and Nhamatanda (144 cases), according to the Ministry of Health. Of these, 376 cases were reported in the last 24 hours.  \n\nHealth partners have also reported malaria cases in many affected areas.  \n\nThis Situation report provides initial estimates of the humanitarian impact of the Cyclone Idai weather system based on population estimates and rapid assessments. Sector-specific needs and requirements will continue to be updated to reflect new data from on-going sector assessments and further analysis.",

HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\u2022 To date a total of 3,453 patients have been managed in health institutions and temporary clinics (Skyline, Copa,  \nNdiadzwa, Beta, Ndima and Vimba) that have submitted reports. These are providing service including supply of chronic diseases medicines.\n\n\u2022 Two patients were air lifted on 2 April from Mutsvangwa to Chipinge and one patient was referred to Mutare Provincial Hospital from Chipinge.\n\n\u2022 A total of 975,646 doses of oral Cholera Vaccine has been approved for two rounds of vaccination in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts. First round of the OCV campaign scheduled for 15th April.\n\n\u2022 A total of 33 Health workers were trained to support detection and reporting of priority diseases/conditions under the early warning alert and response system.\n\n2. BACKGROUND\n\nZimbabwe experienced torrential rainfall caused by Cyclone Idai from the 15th of March 2019 to the 17th of March 2019.Tropical Cyclone Idai which was downgraded to a tropical depression on the 16th of March 2019 caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani, Chipinge, Buhera, Nyanga, Makoni, Mutare Rural, Mutasa and parts of Mutare Urban districts among other districts, causing riverine and flash flooding and subsequent deaths, destruction of livelihoods and properties. Chimanimani district is the most affected with two main centres having received the brunt of the cyclone, Ngangu Township of Chimanimani which experienced landslides and Ngangu growth point which experienced flooding. The objective of this situation report is to provide daily updates on progress on the health situation in the affected areas. We will also provide information on key determinants of health challenges and gaps in service provision.\n\n3. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL OVERVIEW\n\nSince the Cyclone happened there has been no reports of any usual diseases or conditions in the most affected districts. As shown in the graph below, as of week 13 the trend of diarrheal diseases in Chimanimani district is normal ( similar to the same period in 2017 and 2018) . There has been no report of death due to diarrhoea and dehydration among the affected communities.",

    "body": "**Location: ESCOLA PRIMARIA EDUARDO MONDLANE, BEIRA CITY**\n\n**Focus group discussions: Women and Girls, Men and Boys, Mixed group**\n\n**Respondents: 25 women, 17 men (at the school) 24 women**\n\n**Participants: UNHCR, UNICEF**\n\n**Date: 03/04/2019**\n\n**1 . Escola Primeria Eduardo Mondlane, Beira city.**\n\n**General protection situation**:\n\nEscola Primeria Eduardo Mondlane is a temporary camp hosting 610Households/1,510\nIndividuals. There was a recent move to Picoco 1 that led to a decrease in the population to 220\nHouseholds/610 Individuals from estimates shared. The displaced population lived in close to\nPraia Nova which is a beach town, 4 minutes away from the school where they are being\nsheltered.\n\nOn15 March when the cyclone hit, the population living in Praia Nova town fled to seek refuge at\nthe Municipal Authorities office. INGC assisted with their move to the school for safety the same\nday. More groups continued arriving at the school thereafter.\n\nOccupants at the centre sleep in classrooms, with women and children occupying one classroom\nand men the other.\n\nGBV: No threats of SGBV were reported. However, it was realized that incident reporting\nmechanisms had not been established or were not known to the occupants as well as referral\npathways. Community sensitization on this issue required. Discussion by the GBV sub-cluster\ncurrently underway.\n\nSecurity: Since the day of arrival of the affected population to the school, the Government has\nbeen providing security. As a result, the community feels safe with no significant incidents\nreported so far.\n\nOn average hot meals are provided every day at 4:00p.m. by a religious group that came together\nand an NGO called 2+1, who also provide two meals on rare occasions. Their assistance is not\nregular during weekends. Therefore the inconsistency in support poses a risk of engaging in\nunsafe and undignified labor, exploitation including survival sex, child labor and begging and also\nmay have an impact on lactating mothers causing them not to adequately feed their babies.\n\nHealth: Women in reproductive age reported that nurses from Ministry of Health conducted an\nassessment to determine their numbers. However, feedback was not shared thereafter, hence\nthe essence of the exercise not felt.\n\nBoth women and men confirmed that they had enough water and sanitation facilities considering\nthat they are living in a school hence did not feel like their health was compromised due to that.\n\nRegistration: The Government of Mozambique through INGC is fully in charge of registration\nand population data. The INGC officer in charge of the school stated that one of the main\nchallenges is tracking the registered population. This is because they are not issued with any\ndocumentation thereafter. As a result, managing movement in and out of the school remains a\nchallenge.\n\nEducation: There is a need to urgently relocate the population from the schools to the identified\nsite in anticipation of reopening of schools. According to INGC, relocation from High schools is a\npriority as the first semester exams will be undertaken in June. There is a need to sensitize the\ncommunity on the planned move to Escola Secondaria Samora Michel.\n\nPsychosocial support: Just like women, men expressed serious need for basic household items\nand that distributions should target households not classrooms. They also expressed the need\nfor trauma counselling and psychosocial support. They request for support with recreation\nactivities since they are Idle to avoid negative coping mechanisms. One key issue that stood out\nwas that men expressed fear to speak out for fear that the government will kick them out of the\nschool shelter",

    "title": "Malawi, Concept of Operations, March 2019",
    "body": "**Background** \n\nIn early March, a severe weather system formed off the eastern coast of Mozambique and Malawi, bringing heavy rains and strong winds, before tracking back to the Mozambique channel. Here, it intensified into Category 3 Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, once again bringing heavy rains and flooding to Malawi\u2019s southern districts and causing significant infrastructure damage to roads and bridges. 868,900 people are reported to be affected across 15 districts. The worst affected areas are Chikwawa, Machinga, Nsanje, Phalombe and Zomba.  \n\nOn 8 March, the Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster and requested international assistance. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), the country\u2019s national disaster management agency, is leading the response. In support of operations and to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas, WFP - as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster globally - and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MOTPW) - who are lead ministry for Transport, Logistics and Communications Sector - will provide coordination and information management support, as well as facilitating access to common logistics services. \n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks** \n\nIn partnership with the Government of Malawi, the Logistics Sector and partners have identified the following logistics constraints and limitations in delivering life-saving assistance to populations, as well as needs for improvement.  \n\nPersistent heavy rains and severe flooding have damaged logistics infrastructure including roads and bridges across affected areas in southern Malawi, making it challenging for the government and humanitarian community to deliver an effective and efficient logistics response. Some Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps across Phalombe, Nsanje and Chikwawa remain inaccessible and are only reachable by air or boat. While water levels are lowering, rehabilitation works on roads and bridges are ongoing and road conditions remain challenging with many only accessible with 4x4 light vehicles and 4x4 trucks (5 mt capacity). Given the isolated nature of several IDP camps, it is expected that Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) will be required as satellite hubs to ensure the relief items can be rapidly forwarded to affected areas. With an influx of relief items into Blantrye in support of the response, it is also anticipated that additional warehousing will be required to supplement local capacity.  \n\nCoordination and information sharing are key gaps in the humanitarian response that along with duplication of effort, are impacting operational decision making and effectiveness. A strong information management and coordination system is crucial to ensure logistics constraints and bottlenecks are clearly identified and partners work together towards a common response. Moreover, reinforcement of technical logistics expertise will also assist in supporting the response effort.  \n\nBased on the above analysis, the major logistics constraints are:\n\n\u2022 Limited road access to some of the affected areas in Southern Malawi \n\n\u2022 Limited transport capacity, particularly 4x4 trucks, boats and air assets \n\n\u2022 Insufficient storage and transport capacity, particularly in remote areas \n\n\u2022 Lack of consolidated logistics information and coordination efforts Additional needs may be identified during the on-going and planned assessments of the humanitarian supply-chain operations.",

Waters are also receding slowly in the Cuacua River, which flows through the Mopeia District of Zambezia province.\n\n\u2022 The risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains a major concern in the affected areas with cholera cases reported in Beira City and Nhamatanda and malaria cases reported in Beira City, Dondo and Nhamatanda.\n\n\u2022 Logistics Cluster\u2019s partners were trained in Beira on the common logistics services made available to support their operations and how to access them. The Logistics Cluster requires partners to submit their Service Request Forms for transport and temporary storage at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.\n\n\u2022 The Logistics cluster is consolidating the upstream pipeline of humanitarian cargo coming into Mozambique to ensure a seamless provision of services and to avoid bottlenecks. Partners are encouraged to send their incoming cargo requests to florian.luckner@wfp.org.\n\n\u2022 During the Logistics Cluster meeting in Beira on 1 April, a new data-collection tool was showcased to assist in collecting real-time information on road access constraints in affected areas.

    "title": "Malawi Floods: Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) - DREF: MDRMW014 ( update n\u00b0 1: 01 April 2019)",
    "body": "**Description of the disaster**\n\nAccording to 2018/19 seasonal forecast, Malawi was expected to receive normal to above normal amounts of rainfall as most of the southern areas of the country were expected to receive normal to below normal rainfall while the northern part was expecting normal to above rainfall from October 2018 to March 2019. Despite this prediction, the Southern Region received early rainfall, which has been increasing since its onset in January 2019 until March 2019. These rainfalls were a result of the effects of Tropical Cyclone Desmond which was developing between Mozambique and Madagascar with forecast that it would affect Mozambique and Southern parts of Malawi. Although the cyclone did not reach Malawi, its effects resulted in continuous rainfall in the southern part of the country since 22nd January through to 26th January 2019. Within this period, extensive rainfall was received in Blantyre, Chikwawa and Nsanje, according to the Department of Climate Change and Met service, with Chikawa District being most hit, as detailed in the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) of this operation. Based on the preliminary assessment report by the Village Civil Protection Committee (VCPC) and Red Cross volunteer\u2019s observation on the ground, the most affected Traditional Authorities are Makhuwira and Paramount Chief Lundu in Chikwawa. The assessment reported that a total of 15,974 people were affected, 3,154 houses damaged or destroyed and 5,078 people reported to be displaced across at least seven camps set up by communities and government through the VCPCs.\n\nAs of 5 March 2019, a Tropical Cyclone formed in the Mozambique Channel and drifted to Malawi, resulting in heavy rains accompanied by strong winds. The heavy and persistent rain led to severe flooding across most districts in southern Malawi. According to the Government, more than 774,680 people have been affected, including more than 86,976 displaced, with 56 deaths and 672 injuries recorded.  \nFifteen (15) districts have been impacted (refer to table 1 below). The districts affected by this new situation include Chikwawa where the initial DREF is under implementation and Zomba, which is among the most hit districts.\n\nWith agriculture being the main source of livelihood for rural population in the country, the heavy rains and floods have impacted agricultural activities, as fields are inundated, and planted crops have been destroyed. Post-flood assessments will indicate the impact on people\u2019s livelihoods. However, as agricultural production accounted for one-third of Malawi\u2019s GDP in 2017 and about 80% of its export revenue, it is likely that the potential loss of harvest, will impact their livelihoods in the medium and long-term.",

    "body": "**Key Messages**\n\n- In **West Africa**, market supplies are sufficient and regular. Demand is at a seasonal low, with below-average levels in several countries due to increased household stocks and reduced institutional purchases. Coarse grain prices in the Sahel are decreasing or stable compared to the previous month, below last year but near the previous five-year average. Above-average rice prices continued in coastal countries due to currency depreciation and inflation. Disrupted trade activities and atypical market trends persist in insecurity-stricken Greater Lake Chad basin, Tibesti region, northern and central Mali, and Liptako-Gourma region. \n\n- In **East Africa**, markets remain severely affected by insecurity and significant macro-economic challenges in Yemen, South Sudan, and Sudan, resulting in significantly above average prices. The prices of most staple grains increased seasonably in surplus-producing areas due to increased demand in.consumption markets. Livestock prices started to decline along with rangeland conditions during the dry period in parts of Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia. \n\n- In **Southern Africa**, domestic maize supplies continued declining seasonally as the peak lean season period progressed. Maize grain prices were stable or increasing in key reference markets except for South Africa where export parity prices fell after increasing for three consecutive months. Maize grain was generally able to circulate between surplus and deficit areas, except for Zambia where administrative restrictions on exports have reduced both formal and informal exports during the 2018/19 marketing year. \n\n- In **Central America**, maize and bean market supplies remained sufficient but began to decline following the conclusion of the recent Postrera harvest. Carryover stocks and imports also contributed to supplies. Maize and bean price trends varied in February. In Nicaragua, ongoing political tension continued to affect markets and trade dynamics while recent tax reforms may be further contributing to some uncertainty and reactions on markets (FAO). In Haiti, local and imported staple food prices increased significantly as market functionality was severely disrupted from political upheavals early in February. The Haitian gourde depreciated an estimated 6 percent against the USD in month to month terms. \n\n- Regional availability and price trends varied considerably across **Central Asia** with the progression of the marketing year (MY). Despite prolonged periods of dryness and below-average cumulative precipitation, wheat production is expected to be slightly less than the previous year but almost equal to the five-year average. Regional wheat deficits are expected to be filled through intra-regional trade. \n\n- **International** staple food markets are well supplied. Maize and wheat prices were stable, while rice and soybean prices decreased. Global crude oil prices increased for a second consecutive month, while global fertilizer prices fell in February.",

The Food Security and Livelihoods, WASH, Health and Education sectors represent 76.9 per cent of the total funding requirements of the flash appeal. UNICEF is requesting US$ 28.6 million in WASH, Health, Education, Nutrition and Child Protection.  \n\nAs of 29 March, 140,784 people, have been displaced due to the cyclone and flooding. The displaced are largely hosted in 161 transit centres in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces. The largest number of transit centres are in Sofala where at least 109,702 people are hosted in 116 centres. On 27 March, the Government confirmed five cases of cholera at Munhava health centre in Beira City, according to the National Director of Medical Assistance. As of 31 March, 517 cholera cases and one death have been reported, including 246 cases on 31 March alone with 211 cases from one bairo.  \n\nAccording to National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) at least 150,854 students are affected by the floods and cyclones due to the damage of 3,318 classrooms in Sofala, Manica,  \nZambezia and Tete provinces. At least 54 health facilities are affected in Sofala (25), Manica and Zamb\u00e9zia. INGC estimatess, at least 843,723 people were affected by the cyclone and floods in the central region of the country and the death toll has risen to 501. About 84,224 houses were partially or totally destroyed. The agriculture authorities estimate that 684,171 ha of crop area (corresponding to 433,056 farmers) were affected in Sofala, Tete, Zambezia, Inhambane and Manica representing 84 per cent of the planted area in these provinces. UNOSAT and REACH carried out a rapid assessment of damage in Beira city, Macuti neighbourhood with satellite images captured on 26 March 2019, and detected that 2,001 buildings out of 4,102 (49%), were considered potentially damaged.  \n\nThe Logistics cluster reported that Beira city is accessible by road N6 which is open to all traffic including heavy trucks and the sea port is also fully operational. Electricity has been reestablished partially, but many houses do not offer safe conditions yet. Truck access to Dombe, Sussundenga district Manica province is still limited. In Dombe, health centres are reportedly out of medical supplies and essential medicines and most are running without electricity. A private company has set-up a generator for the hospital in Sussungenga district, which is now fully operational. \n\nOn 22 March 2019, the UNICEF Executive director, Ms Henrietta Fore visited Beira and flew over Buzi district and witnessed first-hand the extent of needs and impact caused by cyclone Idai and resulting floods.  \n\nOn 22 March 2019, the IASC activated the SCALE-UP for Mozambique for a period of three months until 25 June 2019. Following the scale up activation, the UNICEF Executive Director Activated the Level 3 (L3) Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP) for the Cyclone Idai response in Mozambique an initial period of three months.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n\u2022 The official death toll has risen to 518 people as of 1 April, according to the Government.\n\n\u2022 More than 1,000 cases of cholera and one death have been reported.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 110,000 houses have been identified by the authorities as totally destroyed (59,910), partially destroyed (33,925) or flooded (15,784).\n\n\u2022 As of 31 March, nearly 33,000 people had been reached with some type of shelter assistance. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nAs of 1 April, the official death toll rose to 518 people; an increase of 17 people since 31 March, according to the Government. Nearly 110,000 houses were identified by the authorities as totally destroyed (59,910), partially destroyed (33,925) or flooded (15,784). More than 146,000 displaced people were sheltering in 155 sites across Sofala (116,237 people), Manica (14,047 people), Zambezia (13,203 people) and Tete (2,655 people) as of 1 April; of whom more than 7,400 were identified as vulnerable, according to the Government. \n\nThe Ministry of Health reported on 1 April that 1,052 cases of cholera had been recorded, including one death. Most of the cases reported have been reported in Beira (959 cases; 1 death), followed by Nhamatanda (87 cases), and Dondo, where a new cholera outbreak was reported, with six confirmed cases. Of these, 258 cases (25 per cent) were reported in the last 24 hours. The cholera outbreak is occurring in both urban (Beira city) and rural settings, including in flooded areas where water, sanitation and health infrastructure has been severely damaged. \n\nMore than 711,000 hectares of crops have been recorded as destroyed, raising concerns over food security and sustainability of return. In Chimoio district alone, authorities report that more than 451,300 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed, comprising 65 per cent of the total crops in the Province. Displaced people living in accommodation centres report that, in addition to damaged or destroyed houses, lack of food and destroyed livelihoods are among the reasons for people not wanting to return, according to Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) monitoring. \n\n**RESPONSE**\n\nThe cholera taskforce is holding daily meetings in Beira to inform operational response. The Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign is scheduled to begin on 3 April and to last six days. Training for personnel giving the vaccinations is underway. Meanwhile, community sensitization is on-going on radio and through printed communication materials to convey messages related to communicable disease control and when to seek health-care. The Community Engagement Group has amplified messages to address and discount rumours that the cholera vaccination will give people cholera. \n\nAs of 31 March, nearly 33,000 people had been reached with some type of shelter assistance, with an increasing pipeline expected; although not for all items. Air and boat lifts transported shelter kits to Buzi Town to cover 4,000 households. Registration has started, with distributions scheduled for 1 April, targeting 1,250 people, with plans to scale up over the coming days. The authorities are requesting for more support with shelter kits for people being relocated from schools to the new accommodation centres, to facilitate the re-opening of schools. The issue of shelter is becoming increasingly critical given the movement of affected people from accommodation shelters to areas of land, which will become permanent housing sites. UNICEF visited one of these new sites and reported that the areas were already hosting many affected people but lacked access to water or sanitation and in need of better shelter materials. There are also concerns around the notice given by the Government on relocation activities and that children will be relocated far from their schools. The Education Cluster are planning to discuss the issue with the Director of Education.\n\nWFP has provided food to 56,000 people in Manica province, covering areas in Buzi and Nhamatanda and are mobilizing support for a further 50,000 people in the coming days. Mussorize remains difficult to access without a helicopter and the team on the ground is looking into possibilities of temporary crossing through Zimbabwe to reach the populations who have had little assistance to date. Some 10,000 people are being targeted for wet feeding in Beira City, with partners scaling up to 15,000 to 20,000 people in coming days. There is more capacity for the partner to scale further but need to identify kitchens in which to prepare the meals. Several schools have been identified and will be piloted as potential feeding sites.  \n\nBetween 65,000 and 75,000 people will be targeted for seed distribution, in view of the limited planting window (1 to 4 weeks) within which a good harvest can be expected. Protection partners are monitoring the new relocation sites for protection risks. More broadly there have been some protection risks identified, particularly in relation to food distributions. There is a need to also target communities outside the transit centres.  \n\nThe municipal authorities, with support from health partners and donors have restored the water supply for Beira city, and are planning the same for Buzi. Bladders have been installed and water trucking in accommodation-centres is ongoing, in addition to the re-establishment of the chlorination plant in Beira city. UNICEF has provided water treatment product (CERTEZA) in Beira neighborhoods to reach 50,000 households and are prioritizing water treatment units to CTCs/Hospitals - currently systems are in Buzi town, Estaguinha, Nhagau Sede/Beira municipality, Macurungo health center. Current constraints include, limited data on number of people affected and in need, lack of enough water tanks, buckets, clinical files, fuel supplies, cholera beds and testing kits.  \n\nThe health cluster in Chimoio has reported a shortage of chlorine, having received only 10 per cent of the required amount. The areas of Gondola and Vanduzi still require chlorine for water treatment. The Director of Health in Chimoio has reported that a stock of 70,000 malaria treatments are available in the province and has requested partners for support in providing mosquito nets.  \n\nA new communication link has been set up at the airport which will enable faster internet. There are currently 810 registered users and around 250 people on the internet at any one time. Buzi now has 3G and a V-SAT is being established in Matarara, according to the Emergency Telecommunication Cluster (ETC)",

These countries include; Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Kenya accounts for 35.4 % (1,198) of the total case load reported this year, followed by Mozambique at 31% (1,048).  \n\nOf the 10 countries with reported cholera / AWD outbreaks in ESAR since week 1 of 2019, 6 (Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Kenya, Zambia and Burundi) have ongoing cholera outbreaks. During the week under review, Mozambique reported the highest number of new cases (1048 cases). Tanzania and Burundi have recorded the highest Case Fatality Rates (CFR) in 2019 at 1.3% and 1% respectively, of the countries with active outbreaks.  \n\n**Mozambique**: Cholera cases in cyclone-hit Mozambique and its associated flooding have risen to 1,048 cases including 1 death (CFR, 0.09%). The Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of cholera on 27 March 2019 with cases reported in Beira and Nhamatanda districts. Recent assessments have shown that health facilities have been destroyed by the cyclone, complicating response efforts. The disease is a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in the southern African nation now living in squalid conditions in camps, schools or damaged homes. Some drink from contaminated wells or filthy, stagnant water. The first round of an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign is starting today (on 3 April 2019), with the second round of vaccination planned in three months. The OCV campaign will target Beira, Buzi, Dondo and Nhamatanda.  \n\n**Tanzania**: An increase in the epidemic trend has been noted in the last two weeks. During week 12 (week ending 24 March 2019), 38 new cases were reported compared to 23 cases reported in week 11 (week ending 17 March 2019). This raises the total number of cholera cases reported since the beginning of 2019 to 154, including 2 deaths (CFR, 1.3 %).

Nearly 100,000 houses were identified by the authorities as totally destroyed (55,095), partially destroyed (28,129) or flooded (15,784). These numbers are expected to continue to rise in the days ahead as more areas become accessible and additional information becomes available.  \n\nAn estimated 141,000 displaced people were sheltering in 161 sites across Sofala (109,700 people), Manica (15,200 people), Zambezia (13,200 people), Tete (2,650 people) as of 30 March, of whom more than 7,400 were identified as vulnerable, according to the Government. On 27 March, IOM\u2019s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) teams visited 32 accommodation sites in Beira, in coordination with the Government of Mozambique, where more than 22,300 people were sheltering, all of whom were displaced from Beira district (Estoril, Esturo and Manga Loforte locations). Twenty-nine of the assessed sites were schools, and the remaining three were community centres. In 22 sites, it was reported that damaged or destroyed houses were the primary reason preventing people from returning home. The remaining reasons were accessibility, basic infrastructure damage, lack of food and no livelihoods.  \n\nThe use of schools as shelters for displaced people and the destruction of more than 3,300 classrooms by the floods, continues to affect the education of nearly 151,000 students, according to the Government. The Government has advised that schools should re-open on Monday, 1 April, and is relocating people currently staying in schools to community centres.  \n\nHumanitarian actors have called for all population movements to be safe, dignified, voluntary and informed.  \n\nThere were 246 cases of cholera reported in Beira City (211) and Nhamatanda (35) by 30 March, and 535 cases of diarrhoea in Beira City (300), Dondo (200) and Nhamtanda (35). Meanwhile, 276 cases of malaria were reported in Beira City (101), Dondo (152) and Nhamtanda (23). There remains a high-risk of spread of both water-borne and vector-borne diseases.  \n\nWater levels continue to recede, but are not yet below medium flood levels, according to analysis. Waters are, however, still rising in some minor watercourses in the Cheringoma Plateau (in Gorongosa National Park, Sofala province), the Savane, Sangussi and Zambazo, and peaks are forecasted within five days (by 2 April). Waters are also receding slowly in the Cuacua River, which flows through the Mopeia District of Zambezia province.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- The official death toll had risen to 493 people as of 29 March, according to the Government.\n\n- A new cholera outbreak was reported in Nhamatande; nine Cholera Treatment Centres have been established in Beira and other locations.\n\n- More than 140,000 people were displaced in 161 sites across Sofala (116 sites), Manica (27 sites), Zambezia (13 sites) Tete (5 sites); of whom more than 7,400 were identified as vulnerable, according to the Government.\n\n- UNICEF, WHO, WFP, COSACA and World Vision released a joint statement on infant feeding in the emergency response in Mozambique. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nAt least 271 cholera cases had been reported in Beira as of 29 March, and a new outbreak was reported in Nhamatande, according to the Ministry of Health. Health partners are focusing on strengthening disease surveillance and cholera case management. Preparations for the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign scheduled for next week are ongoing. Nine Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs) -seven of which are already operational- with approximately 400 beds, have been established since 27 March. Meanwhile, in Manica, a rise in malaria cases has been reported in several districts and the risk of cholera remains high in most affected districts. \n\nAs of 28 March, the official death toll had risen by 25 people to 493, according to the Government. The number of students reportedly affected increased by 44,000 from 28 March, to more than 143,400 students. School drop-out was reportedly already high in affected areas and there are concerns that the current emergency might exacerbate the situation. Several students and teachers are traumatized, and education partners have recommended that a full package comprising psychological counseling, school materials, WASH services and infrastructure be provided when rehabilitating schools. \n\nNearly 141,000 displaced people were sheltering in 161 sites across Sofala (109,700 people), Manica (15,200 people), Zambezia (13,200 people), Tete (2,650 people) as of 29 March, of whom more than 7,400 were identified as vulnerable, according to the Government. Nearly 100,000 houses were identified as totally destroyed (55,463), partially destroyed (28,070) or flooded (15,784) as of 29 March; an increase of more than 7,000 since 28 March. Five alternative temporary spaces were identified for displaced people who were due to be relocated out of schools to allow the resumption of education. Partners have highlighted that the proposed relocation of displaced people should be done on a voluntarily basis. \n\nThe amount of crops reportedly affected rose significantly to nearly 670,000 hectares as of 29 March. There is a two- to four-week window for the planting of seeds to provide a winter harvest. The Food Security Cluster has recommended that the distribution of seeds and hoes should be part of the emergency response and be done simultaneously to food rations. In Manica Province, an assessment team reported that lower lands have been more heavily impacted, with widespread damage to productive land due to the sudden overflow of the Buzi and Lutisi rivers. Higher lands and plateaus are facing less damage and do have some crops intact. However, they have faced two consecutive shocks (drought and floods), seriously eroding their adaptation and resilience mechanisms. \n\nAccessibility by road is improving as roads dry up, and most roads from and to Chimoio are now transitable for all types of vehicles, according to the Logistics Cluster. An assessment is ongoing along Dombe Road, which is partially accessible. The Dombe-Matarara is not paved but is transitable for heavy trucks, while the Chimoio-Dombe road is accessible for light vehicle but restricted for trucks because of steep curves. The Caia-Beira road is reportedly now passable with challenges. The Maputo-Beira road is open to all traffic, including heavy traffic, while the 523 is transitable with medium and light vehicles down to Macate and Nharombe. Buzi is still not accessible by road and the assistance by the French Navy who are fixing the road will take several days. Chimoio remains accessible by road from Zimbabwe and from Maputo. However, road conditions may be challenging when travelling north from the country\u2019s south. Private companies are providing transport services to most locations surrounding Chimoio.",

The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 66 events in the region.  \n\nThis week\u2019s edition covers key ongoing events, including:  \n\n- Response to the tropical cyclone in southern Africa \n- Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n- Meningitis outbreak in Togo \n- Lassa fever outbreak in Liberia.  \n\nFor each of these events, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided.  \n\nA table at the end of the bulletin gives detailed information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have been controlled and thus closed.  \n\n**Major issues and challenges include:**\n  \n- The impact of the devastation wrought by tropical cyclone Idai in Southern Africa has been better elucidated over the past week and the situation remains disastrous. Nearly two million persons are estimated to be affected in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, with access to these people still challenging in some areas due to the destruction of roads. The response to the disaster continues to be scaled up, including activation of the UN Inter Agency Standing Committee scale-up protocol for a period of three months, resulting in activation of the 10 clusters: Education,  \nFood Security and Livelihood, Health, Nutrition, Protection, Shelter/NFIs,  \nWASH, Emergency Telecommunications, Logistics, Camp Coordination and Management. Key immediate concerns, however, remain, including provision of emergency shelter, food assistance, clean water, and protection of children, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities.  \nFor the healthcare sector The Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak this week, which demonstrates the urgent need to enhance the early warning component of the surveillance system due to the increased risk of vector- and mosquito-borne epidemic prone diseases. This will enable early detection and subsequent response to cases. Additionally, trauma care, psychosocial counselling and treatment of common and chronic illnesses are being urgently addressed.  \n\n- The increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo observed last week continues, following a period of decreasing number of cases. Ongoing episodes of violence, together with community concerns and mistrust, are hampering the response efforts to limit disease transmission. Interventions have been successful, however, with health zones with previous high transmission of EVD now controlled. Increased funding and support from the international community are needed to ensure that the outbreak is controlled in the next six months.",

The cyclone also damaged or destroyed more than 99,300 houses, according to the GoM. Casualty figures and damage estimates are expected to continue to rise as flood waters recede and relief agencies identify additional deaths and conduct assessments. Nearly 140,800 people were sheltering in more than 161 accommodation sites in Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zamb\u00e9zia provinces as of March 29, the GoM reports.\n\n- The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Mozambique released a revised 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) on March 25, requesting nearly $282 million to respond to the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Idai. An estimated 1.85 million people are in need of assistance due to the effects of the cyclone, an increase from the initial estimates of 600,000 people, according to the HRP. The appeal identifies food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance as priority needs in affected areas.\n\n- On March 27, USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members traveled to Sofala\u2019s Beira city to observe humanitarian conditions and assess needs in and around the city. The team noted that markets in Beira were operational and observed food and household items for sale. However, hygiene conditions at accommodation centers were poor and food and other supplies provided by humanitarian agencies were insufficient for the number of people in need.\n\n- In addition to the impacts in Mozambique, Tropical Cyclone Idai also caused damage, destruction, and deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. In Zimbabwe, the cyclone resulted in 181 deaths and affected at least 237,000 people, while at least 367,200 people were affected in Malawi. Two USAID/OFDA staff members deployed to Zimbabwe on March 28 to verify unmet needs in the country. The staff members plan to travel to Malawi in the coming days to assess the extent of humanitarian needs in the country.",

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working with Zimbabwe Red Cross Society on the way to channel aid to the affected vulnerable people. At country level, the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society accepts assistance to provide support to the affected population.*\n\n**The situation** \n\nWhile Zimbabwe was responding to a food insecurity emergency from an El-Nino induced poor rainfall season, forecasts were issued that a category 4 Tropical cyclone Idai was developing off the Mozambican coast and would head westwards towards Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. While crossing the Mozambique, Idai weakened to a tropical storm and entered Zimbabwe.  \n\nSince then the remnants of storm have been causing heavy rains over Zimbabwe and Malawi. At least 172 deaths have been reported and 327 people are reportedly missing in Zimbabwe (OCHA, 27 March 2019).  \n\nCyclone Idai triggered floods in Zimbabwe, which swept away hundreds of homes in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the country. The Government declared a state of disaster in affected areas and has allocated $RTGS 50 million for emergency response and infrastructure rehabilitation.  \n\nChimanimani, Chipinge and Mutare districts (Manicaland Province) have been the most affected. In Chimanimani, eight bridges have been destroyed. In Buhera, the Marowanyati dam has overflowed and over 5,000 people are displaced.  \n\nAccess to Chimanimani remains a challenge with 95% of the road networks in the affected areas having been damaged. Access to most communities remains difficult with some still completely under water.  \n\nDamaged infrastructure has rendered some places completely unreachable. At the time of the report, the Zimbabwe National Army has started clearing roads and establishing emergency crossing points for relief vehicles. Zimbabwe Red Cross were one of the first humanitarian actors to gain access to Chimanimani \u2013 one of the worst affected areas. It has been estimated that up to 16,000 HH could be displaced (8,000 HH in Chimanimani, 3,000 HH in Chipinge, 1,000 in Buhera and 4,000 HH in Mutare), however, data on this also varies. Data from the NS indicate 4,313 people are completely displaced.  \n\nRed Cross assessments are on-going as more of the affected areas become accessible. Figures below summarise affected populations based on NS and government figures and for which NS response is based on.",

There have been no new cases reported in the last two days. The number of students affected increased by more than 8,100 from 27 March, to nearly 99,000 students. More than 3,200 classrooms were destroyed or damaged by the floods, while others are being used as accommodation sites. The Government is planning to relocate internally displaced persons from schools \u2013 with priority given to secondary schools \u2013 to other sites, to facilitate the reopening of schools.  \n\nNearly 136,000 displaced people were sheltering in 159 sites across Sofala (109,700 people), Manica (15,200 people), Zambezia (8,000 people), Tete (2,650 people) as of 28 March, of whom more than 7,400 are identified as vulnerable, according to the Government. More than 92,300 houses were identified as totally destroyed (51,584), partially destroyed (25,944) or flooded (15,784) as of 28 March; an increase of nearly 1,000 since 27 March.  \n\nThe risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains a major concern, with reports of rising cases of malaria, in addition to cases of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea. Beira and Dondo are both cholera-endemic areas in Mozambique and the risk of spread is therefore high.  \nMore than 5,000 displaced children, women and men from both Malawi and Mozambique who fled their homes due to the Cyclone Idai weather system are reportedly sheltering in Bangula Camp in Nsanje district in the southern tip of Malawi.  \n\nOxfam distributed WASH materials and hygiene kits to more than the 5,000 people at the camp.  \nFlood waters continue to decrease, leading to increasing movement of people, including in and around Chimoio. However, it will still take some time for the rivers to recede below the medium alert level in most areas. Key areas being monitored for potential new flooding are Marromeu, Nhamatanda, Muanza, Mopeia and Maganja da Costa districts in Sofala and Zambezia Provinces. In the downstream part of the Pungwe basin, around Beira, river flows have receded below medium alert levels and are expected to continue to decrease. However, minor waterways in the Cheringoma Plateau waters are reportedly still rising, with peaks forecasted within five days. This region, just north of Beira, has already seen heavy rainfall.",

The authorities also reported some 2,500 cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) in Beira district. A total of 900,000 cholera vaccine doses, which will be effective for six months, are expected to arrive in Mozambique by 1 April and micro-planning for the vaccination campaign is underway.  \n\nThe number of internally displaced people (IDPs) accommodated in 161 sites across Sofala (119 sites), Manica (27 sites), Zambezia (11 sites) and Tete (4 sites) has risen by more than 9,200 people, to nearly 136,000 people, as of 27 March. More than 92,000 houses were identified as totally destroyed (50,772), partially destroyed (25,769) or flooded (15,784) as of 27 March; an increase of more than 1,300 since 26 March. More than 3,200 schools were destroyed and nearly 91,000 students are affected, including those whose schools are being used as accommodation sites. The Ministry of Education is preparing a timeline to address the forced break in schooling as the authorities work on transferring IDPs from schools into new accommodation sites to allow schools to reopen.  \n\nAn assessment team identified nearly 1,500 people in Pambanisa, Matarara, in Chimoio district, in urgent need of assistance. A food drop to last three days was carried out to assist them immediately and response is ongoing. An airdrop of shelter kits by helicopter is scheduled.\n \nIn Dombe, health centres are reportedly out of medical supplies and essential medicines and most are running without electricity. A private company has set-up a generator for the hospital in Sussungenga district, which is now fully operational.  \n\nWater supply has reportedly been reestablished in Beira, with 60 per cent of the pipes in the city having running water, according to WASH partners. A special water trucking operation is being run by the Government pending the repair of all damaged infrastructure. UK aid flights reportedly transported materials for the repair of the water systems in Beira, while WASH partners have provided technical support, fuel and water treatment chemicals for the systems.  \n\nFuel supply remains scarce in Manica Province. Although reports indicate that gasoline is now coming into the region but only a few people have access to it due to the increased prices and long queues, affecting transport business and movement. The Government has reportedly warned that traders caught speculating will be liable for \u201cseizure of goods and a fine\u201d according to media reports.  \n\nAccess remains a challenge to effective response. The Logistics Cluster has reported that the road from EN1 to Grudja (E3) has been blocked due to 20 metres of water and a mud pool, while the road to Buzi is inaccessible in some areas.",

The next Situation Report will be issued on or around 3 April.*\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n\u2022 181 deaths have been recorded and 330 people are reportedly still missing, as of 25 March.\n\n\u2022 Search and rescue are ongoing, especially in Chimanimani, where several wards/villages remain inaccessible by road.\n\n\u2022 Over 270,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including an estimated 90,000 people (18,000 households) in four districts who need emergency shelter and non-food items.\n\n\u2022 Some 60,000 children are in need of immediate protection services, and 100,000 children are in need of welfare and civil registration services in nine floodaffected districts.\n\n\u2022 About 95 per cent of the roads and bridges have been damaged in Chimanimani. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nFollowing the landfall of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique on 14 March, eastern provinces of Zimbabwe experienced torrential rainfall. The combination of high winds and heavy precipitation in the districts of Chimanimani, Chipinge, Buhera, Nyanga, Makoni, Mutare Rural, Bikita, Masvingo and Gutu resulted in riverine and flash flooding, as well as landslides, causing significant loss of life, injury and displacement.  \n\nAt least 181 deaths and 175 injuries have been reported and 330 people were reportedly missing in Zimbabwe as of 25 March, according to the government. The death toll is expected to rise as areas previously cut-off become reachable by road and the full extent of the damage becomes known. Destruction to infrastructure and property has been severe, and the livelihoods over 270,000 people across these districts has been affected.  \n\nAn estimated 270,000 people have been affected by flooding and are in need of humanitarian assistance in the seven districts\u2014Chipinge, Chimanimani, Buhera, Bikita, Mutare, Gutu, and Chiredzi. The vast majority of people affected are in Chipinge (122,000) and Chimanimani (115,000) districts.  \n\nThis Situation Report provides initial estimates of the humanitarian impact of the Cyclone Idai weather system. Sectorspecific needs and requirements will be updated to reflect new data from on-going sector assessments and further analysis.",

    "body": "**Background** \n\nA weather system that produced heavy rains flooded parts of Malawi in early March 2019, before developing into Cyclone Idai which struck Mozambique and Zimbabwe on 14-16 March, 2019. \n\nThe flooding and damage has destroyed homes and infrastructure, displaced thousands of people and the humanitarian needs are enormous.\n\nWe have emergency response teams on the ground in all three countries. In recent days, assessments have been carried out and we are now undertaking medical activities and responding to humanitarian needs, including providing non-medical items such as buckets and soap, and ensuring safe water and sanitation.\n\nTeams in all the affected countries are mobilising to provide medical and non-medical assistance. In our warehouse in Brussels, an enormous supply and logistics operation is underway, with tons of supplies being sent to the affected areas, particularly Mozambique. \n\n**Mozambique** \n\nMozambique, and particularly the city of Beira, in the centre of the country, has been the hardest hit by Cyclone Idai, which struck on 14 March.\n\n**SITUATION - BEIRA AND SURROUNDS** \n\n- Ninety percent of the area around Beira has been damaged, with roads, electricity and communications having been cut off. \n\n- Buildings have been submerged and severely damaged; many people are staying with family or friends or in transit centres because their homes are uninhabitable. \n\n- Healthcare infrastructure has been damaged, including the hospital; our staff have not yet seen a health centre that is undamaged and fully functional. \n\n- While clean-up efforts by communities are underway, clearing the streets of debris and uprooted trees, extensive repair work to buildings and infrastructure is much needed. \n\n- The cyclone substantially damaged the city\u2019s water supply system, resulting in many people having to drink from contaminated wells or stagnant water. \n\n- As a result of the lack of access to clean water, the Government announced the first recorded cases of cholera on 27 March. \n\n- The flooded area is massive, extending beyond the direct path of the cyclone. \n\n- Authorities have so far confirmed that 447 people have died, with the toll expected to be much higher; over 1,500 people have been injured. \n\n**RESPONSE** \n\nWe currently have four emergency teams, and 35 emergency-experienced staff, on the ground in the flood-affected areas. More staff are en route as we scale up our response. Three charter flights with 43.3 tons of cargo have left Belgium and are arriving in Beira; four more cargo flights are booked in the coming days from Belgium and Dubai, with more planned for the coming weeks. \n\n**Beira and surrounds**\n\nMedical and non-medical activities have begun in Beira and in areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n- Our teams are providing medical consultations via mobile clinics in several neighbourhoods of the city, including going door-to-door, looking particularly for cases of severe watery diarrhoea and cholera. \n\n- We are working at full capacity in one partly-rehabilitated health centre, and are getting up to speed in two other partly-rehabilitated centres. \n\n- Staff are treating more than 200 patients with suspected cholera per day. \n\n- We are also in discussion with the health ministry about supporting a large cholera vaccination campaign in the area. \n\n- Consultations have included treating small wounds, stomach issues (particularly intestinal worms), and respiratory tract infections. \n\n- Teams are also carrying out non-medical activities, including re-roofing two health centres in the poorest and most-affected neighbourhoods. \n\n**Zimbabwe** \n\nCyclone Idai hit Chimanimani, a small district of approximately 30,000 people in Manicaland province, late Friday 15 March, after passing through Mozambique. \n\n**SITUATION** \n\n- The damage in Chimanimani district is massive, with many roads completely wiped away for several kilometres, and the only way to reach some communities is now by foot. \n\n- Access to safe drinking water is an issue with many pipes washed away. \n\n- Official figures, as of 22 March, estimate there have been 154 deaths, 162 injuries, and nearly 5,000 displaced people as a result. \n\n**RESPONSE**     \n\nWe have sent an emergency response team to the mountainous areas of Manicaland province, including the districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge.\n\n**Chimanimani and surrounds**  \n\nAn MSF team was finally able to access the district; this is the first time many parts have been accessed from outside help since the cyclone hit. With many roads washed away or flooded, the teams are walking between 3 to 12 kilometres to reach stranded communities, who have no safe water supply.\n\n- We are providing consultations and medical supplies in the stablisation centre set up on the outskirts of Chimanimani.    \n\n- Our priority has moved to inside Chimanimani and our staff are working with MoH staff out of the hospital.    \n\n- Two outreach teams are also moving around Chimanimani, trying to access health clinics and surrounding settlements to assess health needs, and distribute medicines to clinics and village health workers.    \n\n- Teams are responding to health needs including treating trauma injuries, refilling antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV, and providing medication for people with chronic diseases.    \n\nLonger term, the consequences of blocked access should be considered: electricity was disrupted affecting routine vaccination services; impending stockouts of medical supplies and drugs; treatment interruptions for HIV, TB and chronic disease patients; and a lack of detergents and chlorine.\n\n**Chipinge**\n\nA team has reached Copper, a valley to the south, which was one of the hardest hit areas, to conduct an assessment.\n\n- Sexual & reproductive healthcare for adolescents in Harare (Zimbabwe)    \n\n**Malawi**  \n\nExtremely heavy rains in lower Shire River districts of Chikwawa and Nsanje, in Malawi\u2019s far south, has been compounded by further rains from Cyclone Idai.\n\n**SITUATION**   \n\n- Flooding affected the majority of Nsanje district, in southern Malawi; rains have now largely stopped and access to the flooded areas is improving.    \n\n- Some areas remain under water or cut off with limited phone communication.    \n\n- Around 16,000 households are affected, according to the national disaster report; a huge number of houses have collapsed.    \n\n- Many thousands of people are in displacement camps and makeshifts sites such as schools and churches. Big reconstruction efforts will be required in coming weeks.    \n\n- There's been huge destruction of agricultural crops and animals; an estimated 50 percent of the area\u2019s crops might have been lost.    \n\n- Electricity has returned to Makhanga district, on the eastern bank of the Shire river, which remains the worst-affected area and is still cut off from all road access. \n\n**RESPONSE**   \n\nWe are responding in several areas with mobile clinics, and water and sanitation activities, and continue to work with local Malawian authorities and the Disaster Management department, plus local and international organisations. Most of our response is occurring in hard-hit Makhanga.\n\nSo far, our teams have not detected acute medical needs, but we\u2019re concerned about the many people on chronic medication, including for HIV and TB treatment. To date, there are no reports of waterborne diseases, including cholera, but this remains a concern.\n\n**Overal**  l\n\n- Outreach teams have visited communities to clean and repair boreholes plus test the water quality to ensure access to clean water.    \n\n- Teams are building basic latrines, showers, shelters; are distributing non-food items and hygiene kits; and educating communities on hygiene and safe water practices.    \n\n**Makhanga**  \n\n- A team of 18 people is supporting the health ministry, moving by boat, to cover the needs of an estimated 18,000 people with health, sanitation and non-food-item supplies.    \n\n- In Makhanga health centre, we continue to ensure primary health, HIV services and basic disease surveillance; we are currently undertaking approximately 150 consultations per day.    \n\n- We have so far reached more than 2,000 households with hygiene kits, which includes buckets, cups, and soap.     \n\n- Due to the concern about cholera, we will construct a basic, four-bed cholera treatment unit and conduct training, to be prepared just in case the need arises.",

The cyclone moved across Mozambique and then inland, affecting parts of Malawi and Zimbabwe. The powerful storm brought widespread flooding and destruction.  \n\nSearch and rescue operations are still underway in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Some affected areas are still unreachable. There are more than 760 confirmed fatalities, and that number is expected to increase. There are currently 228,000 people being housed in crowded shelter camps, raising concerns among aid workers and government officials about the risk of disease outbreak.  \n\nIn Zimbabwe, the most affected areas are the rural, agricultural communities of Chimanimani and Chipinge, which already suffer from high rates of poverty. More than 250,000 people were affected, many of whom lost their houses, livestock and crop harvest. The water supply suffered major damage and will require rehabilitation to control the risk of water born disease outbreaks (UNICEF, March 24, 2019).  \n\n**INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE EFFORTS** \n\nOn March 22, the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) for the United Nations declared Scale-Up level (formerly called Level 3) in Mozambique, declaring it the highest level of priority for UN Agencies. The International Red Cross is supporting search and rescue efforts through their local chapters and the governments of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The U.S. and several European countries have committed funding for humanitarian relief efforts.",

The Government of Mozambique (GoM) reported at least 447 confirmed deaths in the country as of March 25, with the numbers expected to rise significantly in the coming days. The cyclone has affected an estimated 1.85 million people, according to relief agencies.\n\n- The GoM National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) and humanitarian actors are continuing to expand relief operations to reach additional populations in need. In recent days, receding waters have allowed for increased access to hard-to-reach areas, such as Sofala\u2019s Nhamatanda District. Relief organizations have begun conducting assessments in Nhamatanda, as well as Manica Province\u2019s Dombe town, and are distributing emergency food and relief commodities in these locations. Rapid response teams are also distributing seven-day rations of emergency food and safe drinking water to hard-to-reach areas to sustain populations until further assistance can be provided.\n\n- On March 24, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) traveled to Sofala\u2019s Beira city and Manica\u2019s Chimoio city, confirming extensive logistical capacity and expansive relief operations currently underway from the cities to other affected locations. The DART continues to identify emergency food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance as priority needs in the response. As of March 25, USAID had provided nearly $3.6 million in food, shelter, and WASH support and was communicating with humanitarian partners on the ground to determine additional needs.",

As of 26 March, nearly 91,000 houses were identified as totally destroyed (50,619), partially destroyed (24,556) or flooded (15,784); an increase of nearly 19,000 since 25 March. The number of people accommodated in 154 sites across Sofala (114 sites), Manica (26 sites), Zambezia (10 sites) and Tete (4 sites) was nearly 128,000 people as of 26 March. The authorities have identified more than 7,400 vulnerable people across the IDP sites.  \n\nFlood waters are beginning to recede west of Beira City, however the situation remains critical in the area of Mafambisse, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The outflow of flood waters, however, poses new challenges, as the area that was previously underwater is now a large muddy swamp, according to analysts. The risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains very high and there are reports of increasing cases of acute watery diarrhoea, along with reports of malaria.  \n\nBusiness owners of destroyed restaurants and hotels in Beira City have requested tax exemptions in order to boost economic recovery. Several hotels, especially along the beach, were destroyed. The owners are trying to repair the damage and restore service, but incalculable losses and the lack of electricity are making recovery more expensive.  \n\nBeira airport is fully operational, but fuel shortages, low fuel refilling capacity, and lack of loading and handling capacities for supplies persist. Chimoio airport has limited operations at night due to lack of a functional illumination system",

The death toll is expected to rise as areas previously cut-off become reachable by road and the full extent of the damage becomes known. \n\nHumanitarian partners estimate that 270,000 people were affected by flooding and landslides, when local rivers and their tributaries burst their banks, inundating homes and schools and causing considerable damage to property and livelihoods. Out of the 270,000 affected people, nearly 240,000 are in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts.  \n\nNearly 4,500 people are displaced, according to the Government. About 16,000 households are in need of shelter assistance in Chimanimani (8,000 households), Chipinge (3,000 households), Buhera (1,000 households) and Mutare (4,000 households). A temporary camp has been established at Skyline, and two additional temporary camps will be established at Wengezi and Ngangu. The displaced people in Chimanimani are currently sheltering at Ngangu primary and secondary schools, Chimanimani Hotel and Ngangu clinic.  \n\nAccording to a rapid assessment conducted on 18 and 19 March, the majority of health care facilities in Chimanimani district were inaccessible, including the district hospital Mutambara Mission and access to the provincial hospital is limited due major destruction of roads and bridges. Facilities of Chipinge district are all accessible. \n\nDisruption of essential health, HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, food and other social services may lead to increased vulnerability of people living with HIV: inability to adhere to treatment; risk of malnutrition, opportunistic infections and disease outbreaks; leading to poor health and in some cases mortality. An HIV rapid assessment is planned to better understand the actual impact of the cyclone on HIV programs, people living with HIV and AIDS affected households. \n\nThe flooding compromised access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene practices in both rural and urban areas, which is increasing the risk of water-borne diseases. The country is facing an outbreak of cholera and typhoid since September 2018.\n\n**RESPONSE** \n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has received a \u20ac250,000 contribution (US$284,414) from the European Union, which will help support the deployment of a UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) helicopter from 25 March that will work to deliver much-needed assistance (medicine, shelter equipment, food and nutrition assistance) and transport of personnel to the areas of Chimanimani and Chipinge, the two most-affected districts. On 26 March, the helicopter was loaded with food and non-food items \u2013 including jerry cans, latrines, plastic sheeting and water purification tablets - and deployed to assess previously unreached locations. For the next three weeks, the helicopter will do five rotations per day into the most affected areas in Chipinge and Chimanimani. It can carry three metric tons or 19 people. \n\nTo date, IOM has distributed 1,000 tarpaulins and 200 non-food items kits for Manicaland (Tanganda, Chipinge and Chimanimani) for initial response.  \n\nThe Government has arranged a storage facility at Silverstream that humanitarian partners can use for emergency response purposes. \n\nAccess remains a challenge in the districts of Mutare, Chimanimani and Chimanimani, with large trucks not able to transit in some roads. In Chimanimani, a makeshift bridge has been constructed to access Copa and Chimanimani town from Chipinge, but is only accessible using 4x4 vehicles.",

Three charter flights with 43.3 tons of cargo have left Belgium and are arriving in Beira; four more cargo flights are booked in the coming days from Belgium and Dubai, with more planned for the coming weeks.\n\n**Beira and surrounds**\n\nMedical and non-medical activities have begun in Beira and in areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n- Our teams are providing medical consultations via mobile clinics in several neighbourhoods of the city, including going door-to-door.\n\n- We are working at full capacity in one partly-rehabilitated health centre, and are getting up to speed in two other partly-rehabilitated centres.\n\n- So far, consultations have been mostly for treating small wounds, stomach issues (particularly intestinal worms), and respiratory tract infections.\n\n- Teams are also carrying out non-medical activities, including re-roofing two health centres in the poorest and most-affected neighbourhoods.\n\n**Zimbabwe**\n\nCyclone Idai hit Chimanimani, a small district of approximately 30,000 people in Manicaland province, late Friday 15 March, after passing through Mozambique. \n\n**SITUATION**\n\n- The damage in Chimanimani district is massive, with many roads completely wiped away for several kilometres, and the only way to reach some communities is now by foot.\n\n- Access to safe drinking water is an issue with many pipes washed away.\n\n- Official figures, as of 22 March, estimate there have been 154 deaths, 162 injuries, and nearly 5,000 displaced people as a result. \n\n**RESPONSE**\n\n- We have sent an emergency response team to the mountainous areas of Manicaland province, including the districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge. Chimanimani and surrounds An MSF team was finally able to access the district; this is the first time many parts have been accessed from outside help since the cyclone hit. With many roads washed away or flooded, the teams are walking between 3 to 12 kilometres to reach stranded communities, who have no safe water supply.\n\n- We are providing consultations and medical supplies in the stablisation centre set up on the outskirts of Chimanimani.\n\n- Our priority has moved to inside Chimanimani and our staff are working with MoH staff out of the hospital.\n\n- Two outreach teams are also moving around Chimanimani, trying to access health clinics and surrounding settlements to assess health needs, and distribute medicines to clinics and village health workers.\n\n- Teams are responding to health needs including treating trauma injuries, refilling antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV, and providing medication for people with chronic diseases.  \nLonger term, the consequences of blocked access should be considered: electricity was disrupted affecting routine vaccination services; impending stockouts of medical supplies and drugs; treatment interruptions for HIV, TB and chronic disease patients; and a lack of detergents and chlorine. Chipinge\n\n- A team has reached Copper, a valley to the south, which was one of the hardest hit areas, to conduct an assessment.\n\n**Malawi**\n\n- Extremely heavy rains in lower Shire River districts of Chikwawa and Nsanje, in Malawi\u2019s far south, has been compounded by further rains from Cyclone Idai. \n\n**SITUATION**\n\n- Flooding affected the majority of Nsanje district, in southern Malawi; rains have now largely stopped and access to the flooded areas is improving.\n\n- Some areas remain under water or cut off with limited phone communication.\n\n- Around 16,000 households are affected, according to the national disaster report; a huge number of houses have collapsed.\n\n- Many thousands of people are in displacement camps and makeshifts sites such as schools and churches. Big reconstruction efforts will be required in coming weeks.\n\n- There's been huge destruction of agricultural crops and animals; an estimated 50 percent of the area\u2019s crops might have been lost.\n\n- Electricity has returned to Makhanga district, on the eastern bank of the Shire river, which remains the worst-affected area and is still cut off from all road access. \n\n**RESPONSE**\n\n- We are responding in several areas with mobile clinics, and water and sanitation activities, and continue to work with local Malawian authorities and the Disaster Management department, plus local and international organisations. Most of our response is occurring in hard-hit Makhanga. So far, our teams have not detected acute medical needs, but we\u2019re concerned about the many people on chronic medication, including for HIV and TB treatment. To date, there are no reports of waterborne diseases, including cholera, but this remains a concern. Overall\n\n- Outreach teams have visited communities to clean and repair boreholes plus test the water quality to ensure access to clean water.\n\n- Teams are building basic latrines, showers, shelters; are distributing non-food items and hygiene kits; and educating communities on hygiene and safe water practices.  \nMakhanga\n\n- A team of 18 people is supporting the health ministry, moving by boat, to cover the needs of an estimated 18,000 people with health, sanitation and non-food-item supplies.\n\n- In Makhanga health centre, we continue to ensure primary health, HIV services and basic disease surveillance; we are currently undertaking approximately 150 consultations per day.\n\n- We have so far reached more than 2,000 households with hygiene kits, which includes buckets, cups, and soap.\n\n- Due to the concern about cholera, we will construct a basic, four-bed cholera treatment unit and conduct training, to be prepared just in case the need arises.",

    "title": "Logistics Cluster Concept of Operations, 26 March 2019 - Cyclone Idai",
    "body": "**Background** \n\nOn the evening of Thursday 14 March Category 3 Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Beira, Mozambique\u2019s fourth largest city, bringing high wind speeds of up to 224 km per hour and heavy rains. The cyclone followed extensive flooding throughout the Mozambique provinces of Zamb\u00e9zia, Tete and Niassa in early March. Ongoing assessments are being undertaken by government officials and humanitarian workers to determine immediate needs, however significant infrastructure damage has been reported, with heavy rainfall over a number of days has causing damage to road and bridges, and interrupting regular supply routes. Sofala province is expected to be the worst affected. There are also growing concerns regarding the potential effects of the overflow of the Marowanyati Dam in Zimbabwe on water levels in Mozambique, which could lead to further deterioration of roads and infrastructure (OCHA). \n\nThe Government of Mozambique (GoM) has declared a state of national emergency and requested international assistance. The National Disaster Management Agency (INGC) is leading the response. The Logistics Cluster was activated on 20 March. WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has been requested by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) to provide coordination and information management support, and facilitate access of common logistics services to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver life-saving items across affected areas.\n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks** \n\nThe cyclone path has seriously damaged logistics infrastructures across the affected areas including warehouses, ports, airports, roads and bridges. Until 24 March, Beira is currently only accessible via sea and air. This includes the main supply route from Beira to Harare (Zimbabwe) via Chimoio, where bridges have reportedly collapsed and parts the road remain flooded. An 18 March aerial survey of the Buzi area showed more than 50 km of land in Buzi town had been submerged. Moreover, several roads north of Caia in the Zamb\u00e9zia province remain impassable. Given high water levels, road access will continue to remain a key challenge to access affected populations. This is further hindered by the local market\u2019s limited capacity to provide specific truck types suitable for such conditions. \n\nIn relation to storage, the cyclone has caused extensive damage to infrastructure. In Beira operational warehousing will remain limited until rehabilitation work is complete and cargo stored in damaged warehouses will have to be transferred. It is anticipated that available storage capacity will be fully occupied in the coming days. Temporary storage solutions such as Mobile Storage Units (MSU) will be required until impacted infrastructure returns to operational use.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the major logistics constraints limiting humanitarian operations in Sofala, Manica and Zamb\u00e9zia Provinces of Mozambique currently are:\n\n\u2022 A lack of available storage capacity (Beira and Chimoio);\n\n\u2022 Insufficient transport capacity (air assets, small trucks or off-road truck and river boats);\n\n\u2022 Possible congestion at entry point (Beira)",

So far, no funds have been received.\n\n**Situation Overview** \n\nOn 22 March, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) officially activated the ETC as part of the Scale-Up protocol for three months. As of 24 March, the official death toll had risen to 446 and more than 1,500 people were injured, according to the Government. The death toll is expected to continue to rise as flood waters recede and more people are reached by response teams. As of the same date, 58,660 houses were reported totally destroyed, (36,747) partially destroyed (19,733) or flooded (2,184).  \n\nWFP-funded drones are supporting rapid assessments with the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) and locating survivors trapped in the flooded areas in Sofala. Bilateral support is increasing, with the arrival of both Search and Rescue (SAR) and Emergency Medical Teams (EMT). Satellite imagery shows numerous floodplains, including an inland ocean 125 km by 25 km \u2013 the size of Luxembourg \u2013 where water levels surged as high as 11 metres. Electricity from the power grid in Beira continues to be non-functional. Lack of access to safe water remains a major concern.",

Nearly 129,000 people were accommodated in 143 sites across Sofala (103 sites), Manica (26 sites), Zambezia (10 sites) and Tete (4 sites), as of 25 March, an increase of more than 20,200 people since 24 March, across the affected areas. Some 72,260 houses are reportedly totally destroyed (36,747), partially destroyed (19,733) or flooded (2,184), with more than 497,700 hectares of crops damaged. \n\nReports of acute watery diarrhoea cases are increasing in areas impacted by the cyclone and floods, although the exact number of cases is yet to be confirmed. Health partners are in the process of identifying suitable locations for the establishment of treatment centers and it is expected that the figures of those infected will become clearer as people report to the centres. Key messages on the signs and symptoms of diarrhoea, when and where to seek help, prevention and general hygiene are being conveyed on local radio with the support of the Community Engagement Group. \n\nOn 23 and 24 March, a joint government-led multi-agency rapid needs assessment was conducted in Donbe, Matara and Sussundega, in Chimioi District, Manica Province. More than 13,300 people affected by Cyclone Idai and floods were identified in six locations: Chimoio, Gondala, Macate, Matarara, Sussundega and Vanduzi. The number of deaths in the district is reportedly rising, as the flood waters recede, with nine bodies found in Donbe this week. Efforts are underway to improve management of dead bodies, as mortuary facilities were either destroyed and/lack enough facilities and capacity.  \nPriority needs in the affected parts of the district are food, with specific requests for cereals, vegetables, oil, salt, and biscuits, and non-food items, including kitchen sets, blankets, plastic sheeting and mosquito nets. The Provincial Governor has reportedly expressed concern over the potential for an outbreak of various water and vector-borne diseases, due to the challenging sanitation conditions and limited access to clean drinking water in the accommodation sites and surrounding areas. The Department of Health is planning to increase hygiene promotion activities, while Public Works Department will review the status of water provision in the shelters.  \nSeparately, preliminary reports from an initial assessment conducted by the local authorities in Nhamatanda district in Sofala Province indicate that the entire District (245,000 people) has been affected by Cyclone Idai and related floods. \n\nNearly 15,000 people are sheltering in 14 sites in Nhamatanda Vila (6 sites), Bededo (5 sites) and Metuchira (3 sites). All houses in Metuchira - home to nearly 38,000 people - were reportedly destroyed and authorities have requested support with tents/tarps and other non-food items for displaced people, who are currently sheltering in schools in the area.  \nSimilarly, in Lamego, nearly 30,000 people are affected, the majority having lost their houses after the sugar plantation dam broke its banks. Displaced people from Lamego are sheltering in Vila. At least 33 deaths were reported from Lamego, according to the authorities. Due to poor information flow in and out of Bebedo and Nhampoca locations, authorities fear that an unknown number of people are reportedly still stranded and surrounded by water. On 20 March, a canoe ferrying the local nurse and other rescued people capsized and their whereabouts remain unknown.  \nAccording to the authorities, people in emergency shelters in Nhamatanda District are reportedly without enough food and the current food stocks will run out within a week. Incidents of diarrhoea have been reported by the district health authorities. \n\nHealth facilities have been damaged, and only temporary/mobile centers are operational, with limited antibiotics and rehydration salts in Vila for the treatment of diarrhoea. The water supply system was damaged, and many latrines destroyed; contaminated water has reportedly leaked into the wells, compromising the sanitation situation. The local administrator has raised concern that the use of schools as accommodation centres has compromised the school schedule, meaning that children will have to stay longer in school during the holiday period to make up for lost time.  \n\nRoad access in all the 11 locations in the district have been damaged; majority by erosion, while others are still flooded.  \nThe authorities have requested for assistance with the rebuilding of infrastructure, including bridges and culverts to allow flood water to flow below the roads. Electricity supply in the district has been disconnected as repair works continue in the area, according to the assessment report. Vodacom is supporting the communities with limited mobile communication and free phone-charging services to facilitate communications with families. Markets and shops in Vila are functional, although commodity prices have risen, creating problems of access for the community. Fuel shortages are imminent, according to the assessment report.",

Thousands of people in Mozambique are reportedly still waiting to be rescued after several days, mainly because of the overwhelming scale of the disaster. While search and rescue operations are ongoing, other immediate needs are emerging, including access to potable water, food and shelter, while the risk of outbreaks of communicable diseases is ever increasing.  \nRestoration of healthcare services is therefore paramount to prevent, prepare for and respond to outbreaks of communicable diseases as well as provide trauma care, psychosocial counselling and treatment of common and chronic illnesses.\n\nThe Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. The past week has seen an increase in the number of EVD cases reported after weeks of overall declining trends. This rise could be partly attributed to the disruption of response interventions following the recent spate of insecurity, including attacks on treatment centres, and pockets of community mistrust. This phenomenon also demonstrates how easy it is to lose the gains already made if the ongoing responses are not sustained. Currently, response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas and there are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the ongoing insecurity.",

Contributions and pledges made amount $11 million, leaving a gap of $31.3 million.\n\n\u2022 Partners are preparing an application to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to complement on- going response efforts.\n\n\u2022 An inter-agency assessment team, including national and international partners, deployed to Mangochi, Machinga, Balaka and Zomba districts to conduct verifications of areas reporting internally displaced people.\n\n\u2022 The Early Recovery Cluster has been activated. This will work on identifying and addressing recovery needs of the affected population.\n\n\u2022 The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) met on 22 March to maximize coordination with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) and the various humanitarian partners. The HCT reviewed the draft response plan. \n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nFollowing the declaration of the State of Disaster on 8 March, an appeal for support from local and international organizations was made. This triggered response operations aimed at meeting the immediate and life-saving needs of the affected people. So far, food and non-food items have been provided to the affected populations with an estimated coverage of at least 95 per cent of the sites. The main challenge however is inadequacy of the distributed food. Most of the food items lasted 3 to 7 days and considering that most of the IDPs will likely be displaced for a period of a month to two, food remains a big gap. All affected areas are now passable by road. Mlolo Traditional Authority (T/A) which was cut off and only accessible by boat and air, is now accessible through the Chikwawa-Thabwa road.  \n\nThe government, through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), has facilitated the development of a Flood Response Plan. The plan is costed at US$42.3 million. Contributions and pledges made so far amount $11 million, leaving a gap of $31.3 million. The plan seeks to support response interventions around Food Security, Agriculture, Nutrition, Protection, WASH, Education, Health, Shelter and Camp Management and Coordination clusters. The HCT met on 22 March and reviewed the response plan.  \n\nDoDMA deployed a national level interagency assessment team to Balaka, Mangochi, Machinga and Zomba districts. The mission is working on verifying the extent of damage, identifying realistic options for humanitarian response and providing clear recommendations to government, international community and humanitarian decision-makers on appropriate response interventions. The verified figures will be used to revise the figures of affected population. So far, the assessment indications show that close to 50 per cent of the people that were initially displaced and seeking temporary shelter in camps have gone back to their communities to try and start the recovery process (rebuilding). In Zomba, displacement camps are mainly in schools and churches. While most have made an arrangement where IDPs use the school blocks in the night, in a few schools such as Sunuzi Primary School in Zomba district, there has been disturbances in school session as four classes are learning outside in order to accommodate the IDPs in the school blocks. A block in Sunuzi primary school also collapsed.  \n\nWhile some schools have adequate toilet facilities to cover the pupils and IDPs, there are some schools that critically need additional toilets. In Nantchegwa primary school in Zomba, there is only one toilet as the others are damaged. This has resulted in open defecation which is a health hazard and may cause diseases such as cholera. Almost all displacement sites do not have bathrooms.  \n\nCritical needs remain food and shelter to accommodate the IDPs. Family tents are the most suitable as IDPs are most likely to require shelter for the next two months. Reconstruction will most likely commence in May after cessation of rains. Other needs include NFIs such as kitchen utensils and mosquito nets.  \n\nWith the recent rains that fell in the southern districts of the country, DoDMA issued a press release for people in Zomba district and city to be on high alert as Chagwa dam in Zomba Mountain was about to collapse. The embarkment on the downstream has significantly eroded causing excessive leakage of water. The dam is currently at full capacity and chances of collapsing are still high and likely to affect settlements located along the Mulunguzi river. Although the number of people at risk is yet to be determined, communities have been alerted. Close monitoring of dam levels is ongoing.  \n\nThe humanitarian response needs to focus on meeting urgent yet diverse needs of affected women\u2014 including pregnant and lactating mothers\u2014girls, boys and men, adolescents and youths, the elderly, and people with disabilities, while also protecting them from violence, abuses and exploitation and maintaining their dignity. To best inform response programming, there is an urgent need to establish gender/age disaggregated data and to apply an age-gender-diversity mainstreaming tool across the clusters.",

    "body": "HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\u2022 The official death toll had risen to at least 446 people as of 24 March, according to the Government, and is expected to continue to increase as more areas become accessible.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 110,000 people are sheltering in 130 collective sites across Sofala (more than 78,400 people), Manica (more than 14,800 people); Zambezia (more than 9,600 people); and Tete (more than 6,800 people).\n\n\u2022 The authorities have identified more than 6,500 vulnerable people, including the elderly, disabled, sick, orphaned and separated children; family tracing is ongoing to reunify separated families.\n\n\u2022 Reports of acute watery diarrhoea are increasing, according to the Government.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nAs of 24 March, the official death toll had risen to 446 and more than 1,500 people were injured, according to the Government. The death toll is expected to continue to rise as the flood waters recede and more people are reached by response teams. \n\nMore than 109,700 people were accommodated in 130 sites across Sofala (90 sites), Manica (26 sites), Zambezia (10 sites) and Tete (4 sites), as of 24 March. In the community of Matarara in Manica province, the numbers of displaced people have reportedly risen as a previously isolated population has managed to reach the locality in recent days, according to humanitarian partners. \n\nSome 58,660 houses were reported to have been totally destroyed (36,747), partially destroyed (19,733) or flooded (2,184) as of the same date. Approximately two thirds of houses in Beira City have suffered roofing damage and the other third have suffered structural failure, according to rapid look and see visits by the Shelter Cluster. \n\nProtection partners continue to receive daily calls from desperate parents who have been separated from their children, according to Save the Children, who have emphasized the critical need to reunite unaccompanied children with their families. Some of the unaccompanied children are traumatized as they reportedly saw their parents being swept away by the floods or have lost siblings. Announcements are being made on radio, encouraging parents who have been separated from their children to call the Government or aid organizations, and also through an online platform run by the Red Cross: https://familylinks.icrc.org/cyclone-idai/. Reintegration of orphaned kids with relatives is also ongoing. \n\nElectricity has been restored to parts of Beira City, including at Beira hospital. However, electricity from the power grid in Beira continues to be non-functional. Due to the lack of electricity, there has been an increase in fuel demand in Sofala Province to operate generators, but fuel trucks are stuck in Inchope on their way to Beira as the road is inaccessible. There are reports of long queues at petrol stations, according to the Logistics Cluster. \n\nWater pumping and treatment stations put in place by the Government Water Agency (FIPAG) are bringing clean water to Beira and Dondo districts. However, lack of access to safe water remains a major concern and there are increasing reports of acute watery diarrhoea in Beira, according to the Government. In Manica, there are reports of increased incidences of malaria. However, exact figures are not yet available. \n\nThe water levels in flooded areas are going down, and the Government is working on repairing damaged road infrastructure connecting Beira. The Caia-Beira road is now passable, but with significant limitations, particularly between Muanza and Inhaminga in Chingoma district, according to the Logistics Cluster. On 23 March, 15MT trucks managed to pass the road without problems, while a 30MT truck passed but with serious difficulties. The Logistics Cluster recommends experienced drivers and robust trucks for this road, as well as a front-end loader available to accompany the trucks. The road from Maputo to Chimoio (N1) remains accessible; one of the three affected points of the Chimoio-Beira road (N6) has been temporarily fixed. INGC confirmed that the N6 is expected to be transitable on 25 March. This will allow larger quantities of food and other supplies to be to be brought to flooded areas in Nhamatanda, West of Beira, and to the city itself. The Cluster estimates that reaching Beira from Maputo by truck will take two to three days approximately. \n\nRESPONSE \n\nIn Beira, a grid-based system has been put in place to assess and prioritize areas for airlift of essential life-saving kits. An MI-8 transport helicopter contracted by the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) is airdropping inter-agency emergency kits, including food (high-energy biscuits (HEBs) and micronutrient-rich peanut paste used to prevent and treat malnutrition) as well as tents, medicines and other essentials for stranded communities outside Beira. WFP-funded drones are supporting rapid assessments with the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) and locating survivors trapped in the flooded areas in Sofala. Bilateral support is increasing, with the arrival of both Search and Rescue (SAR) and Emergency Medical Teams (EMT). Two UNHAS MI-8s helicopters and a C295 cargo plane are now operational in Beira.  \n\nHumanity & Inclusion is assessing the areas of Beira that pose the greatest logistics challenges in accessing people in need, especially vulnerable groups. The Organisation\u2019s office in Beira was reportedly destroyed, hampering immediate response. A team of emergency experts and specialized equipment, including mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, crutches, and walkers, are being deployed so that injured people or people who have lost their walking aids, can move around.  \n\nSeveral generators, as well as a logistics kit containing the necessary equipment to install a temporary base for the growing Humanity & Inclusion team will arrive. The team plans to provide food aid to about 60,000 families and hygiene kits to more than 3,000 families and also work with humanitarian actors to ensure that the most vulnerable people are included in the emergency response.  \n\nThe Community Engagement (CE) Group in Beira, co-led by UNICEF and OCHA, continues to identify and use different platforms to establish communication links with affected communities. Current messaging is aimed at dissuading rumors, including a false rumour circulating that a new cyclone will arrive in Buzi. Radio Mozambique has offered free airtime for this purpose and the Government has given an approval for First Response Radio to establish Emergency Response Radio (ERR), in collaboration with a local community radio station. Translators Without Borders have translated Community Engagement questionnaires into Portuguese and disseminated them to Clusters and partners to be used in detailed assessments. Government counterparts have been identified from the Institute of Social Communication (ICS) and will be attending CE meetings, along with representatives of community radio stations.  \n\nMore than 100,000 affected people have received WFP food assistance. WFP is also scaling up its commodity voucher assistance in Beira to assist 250,000 affected people for a full month. A WFP team is establishing an operation hub in Chimoio to support the response in Manica and a 20MT consignment of High Energy Biscuits (HEBs) arrived in Chimoio to be distributed to populations in isolated areas.  \n\nIndia has sent another Indian Navy ship (INS MAGAR) as part of its operation \u201cSahayata 2019\u201d to Mozambique, according to media reports. The ship reportedly contains medicines, dry provisions, ready-to-eat meals, daily essentials and clothing items and would cater to approximately 1,000 people for seven days. In addition, the authorities have reported that some 500kg of epidemic-related medicines and 400 tonnes of rice will be donated to the affected areas. Indian Navy ships have also been providing fresh water in relief camps, undertaking community service, including clearing of debris and repairing damaged roads. Food supplies have also been provided to about 700 persons working in the port area.  \n\nFUNDING/PLEDGES \n\nOn 22 March, the Government of Ireland announced that it will contribute over \u20ac1 million in Irish funding to support people affected by floods and Cyclone Idai in Mozambique (\u20ac400,000 to WFP), Malawi (\u20ac150,000 to Concern Worldwide) and IFRC/Red Cross operations in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (\u20ac500,000).  \n\nOn 23 March, Global Affairs Canada announced $3.5 million cyclone aid funds to support humanitarian organisations responding to the worst-hit areas in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The IMF has reportedly dispatched a team to Mozambique to aid economic recovery efforts and has announced a 100 per cent matching program for all staff donating to relief efforts for the region, according to media reports.",

UNICEF HAC currently under review to reflect these needs)\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nZimbabwe experienced torrential rainfall caused by Cyclone Idai from the 15 to 17 of March 2019. Cyclone Idai caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani, Chipinge, Buhera, Nyanga, Makoni, Mutare Rural, Bikita, Masvingo and Gutu Districts causing riverine and flash flooding and subsequent deaths, and destruction of livelihoods and property. To date, Chimanimani district is the most affected.  \nAn estimated 50,000 households/250,000 people, including 120,000 children, have been affected by the flooding and landslides after local rivers and their tributaries burst their banks. The flooding has caused significant damage to homes, schools, and other property, and in some cases led to death.  \nAs of 22 March, 154 people had been reported dead and 189 people are reported missing. The number of deaths is expected to increase as the search and rescue efforts continue. The water supply in Chimanimani and Chipinge have suffered significant damage and will require rehabilitation.\n\nOver 250 boreholes and 18 urban and peri-urban water supply systems were damaged. Following the cyclone, about 5,000 metres of the water distribution network was washed away in Chimanimani town, depriving more than 9,000 residents of safe water. Thirteen health care facilities in Chimanimani district are inaccessible, including Mutambara Mission Hospital and Chimanimani District hospital. This can increase the risk of water born disease outbreaks; before the flood, the Chipinge and Chimanimani districts had low sanitation coverage (43 per cent and 46 per cent respectively).",

A further 162 people are reportedly injured and 136 are still marooned, according to government reports. The death toll is expected to rise as areas previously cut-off become reachable, and an additional 500 people are still missing in Rusitu Valley in Chimanimani District, where rescue efforts have been hampered by damaged roads, according to IOM. \n\nIn Chimanimani and Chipinge districts, an estimated 250,000 people have been impacted, according to the preliminary findings of an inter-sector joint rapid needs assessment mission. The mission reported further that an estimated 37 per cent (121,000 people) of the rural population in Chipinge district require urgent food assistance, while 77 per cent (114,000 people) are in need of food assistance in Chimanimani. At least 35,000 households - with over 120,000 women and over 60,000 children - are in urgent need of protection interventions in the two assessed districts (Chimanimani and Chipinge). An estimated additional 100,000 children are in need of welfare and civil registration services in nine districts. \n\nInfrastructure has sustained significant damage. Some 95 per cent of the road networks in the affected areas have been damaged, according to government reports, with bridges reportedly damaged at Mhandarume, Matsororo, Mvumvumvu, Biriri, Muusha Primary School and Nyahode. In addition, some 48 schools, 18 water points and 10 bridges have been damaged or destroyed, according to preliminary government reports. Manyera dam wall in Vumba has reportedly weakened and increased community awareness is required. At least 200 poles have been washed away along the Chipinge to Chimanimani electricity line, leaving many people without power.",

More than 89,100 people are sheltering in 122 sites across Sofala (90 sites), Manica (18 sites), Zambezia (10 sites) and Tete (4 sites), with an increase of 17 more sites in Sofala province since 20 March. More than 1,500 people have been injured and the number of victims continues to rise as the waters recede and more people are reached by response teams.    \n\nSome 3,140 schools have been destroyed, affecting more than 90,000 students, according to Government figures on 23 March. More than 33,600 houses have been totally destroyed (20,282), partially destroyed (17,137) or flooded (2,184), according to the authorities, and nearly 500,000 hectares of crops have reportedly been destroyed, heightening the risk of rising food insecurity in affected communities. Women in Mozambique play a critical role in agricultural production and at the same time remain responsible for the majority of caregiving. With the caregiving burden likely to increase in the aftermath of the cyclone and floods \u2013 as illness and injury have risen \u2013 women may have to decrease their agricultural production, risking further increases in food insecurity. UNFPA estimates that about 74,650 women impacted by the cyclone are pregnant of whom 60 per cent (43,000) are estimated to give birth in the next six months. Of these, about 7,465 are at risk of life-threatening complications of pregnancy and will need access to functioning health facilities and care.    \n\nWater levels in Buzi and Pungue rivers have reportedly receded, but the region remains at risk as rains continue in multiple locations. The Cahora Bassa dam in Tete Province has reached capacity and will be discharged to recover storage capacity in preparation for anticipated additional rains in the coming week. Although this does not produce a high risk of flooding, weather experts have identified some areas that are on alert. Meanwhile, the Marowanyati dam in Zimbabwe has been hit by heavy rains, putting populations in the river basin at high risk. The rainfall could lead to a potential rise in some smaller coastal basins in Mozambique between Beira and Zambezi River mouth.    \n\nCommodity prices in Beira continued to rise and buyers are reportedly unable to afford goods, where available, according to field reports. Almost 80 per cent of the economic infrastructure, including warehouses, storage silos and supermarkets in Beira have been destroyed, leaving behind damaged goods, according to the Logistics Cluster. Stalls in the Maquinino informal market - Beira\u2019s largest - have all been destroyed, impacting the availability of essential products. A box of tomatoes that cost about 500 meticals a week ago now costs between 2,000 and 2,500 meticals, according to the local community.    \n\nThe situation in Chimoio remains critical. Two bridges collapsed and another five are still flooded in Mossurize and Sussundenga districts in Manica province, according to Save the Children. Mossurize District is isolated from the rest of the province and entry is only possible via Zimbabwe. Crops in the Chimoio green belt, which provides the livelihood of hundreds of families through the production of cereal and vegetables, have been flooded.    \n\nIn Zambezia district, 308 classrooms (88 conventional and 220 traditional) were destroyed during the floods, according to a rapid assessment conducted in the district. Some of the affected children have been integrated in schools near accommodation centres. The Ministry of Education has requested more than 23,000 student kits, 576 teacher kits, 15 Early Childhood Development (ECD) kits, 10 classroom tents and 500 tents. The Ministry of Public Works has requested a variety of items such as water pumps, water treatment systems, water tanks, hygiene kits, plastic rolls and fuel.    \n\nLogistics remain a challenge. The corridor from Mutare (Zimbabwe) to Chimoio is open; Beira and Chimoio airports are fully operational; the Beira sea port and railway services (Sena railway line) between Tete (Moatize) and Beira cities are also operational. Stocks of Jet-A1 fuel are reportedly available in Tete and Quelimane. However, these must be airlifted to Beira where there are limited stocks and no Jet-A1 fuel is currently available in Chimoio. Electricity from power grids in Beira continues to be non-functional, leaving large parts of the city without sustained power. At least 80 per cent of the electrical infrastructure in Dondo district is damaged, according to the Government. On 20 March, the national electricity company airlifted power equipment to Beira to provide alternate power services. Storage capacity in Beira remains constrained and the Logistics Cluster is closely monitoring the situation to avoid bottlenecks at both the port and airport.",

Formal activation of all clusters along with the SCALE-UP protocol for 3 months was confirmed by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) on 22 March.\n\n\u2022 The ETC Coordinator continues to engage with the response community and relevant government authorities to determine their ICT needs and planned activities to ensure an effective response.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nThe National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) of Mozambique estimates that 600,000 people are currently at risk and in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the affected areas. The situation is likely to continue to deteriorate, and the number of people affected is likely to increase, as more heavy rainfall is predicted. An aerial survey of Buzi \u2013 home to more than 200,000 people \u2013 conducted after reports that the Buzi and Pungwe rivers had burst their banks, found thousands of people marooned on rooftops. The immediate priority is search and rescue for people stranded by flood waters. Main roads into and out of Beira remain cut due to flood waters and extensive damage to the road network",

In recent days, assessments have been carried out and we are now starting medical activities and responding to humanitarian needs.\n\nTeams are mobilising to provide medical and non-medical assistance. In our warehouse in Brussels, an enormous supply and logistics operation is underway, with tons of supplies being sent to the affected areas, particularly Mozambique.\n\n**MOZAMBIQUE**\n\nMozambique, and particularly the city of Beira, in the centre of the country, has been the hardest hit.\n\nNinety percent of the area around Beira has been destroyed, with roads, electricity and communications having been cut off, and buildings have been submerged and severely damaged, including the hospital. Hundreds of people have been confirmed to have died, and authorities expect the toll to be much higher.\n\n**Response**\n\nA team of six emergency-experienced staff are now on the ground in Mozambique, with more to follow in the coming days. In Beira, medical activities have begun, with consultations being provided through a mobile clinic.\n\nTeams are also carrying out non-medical activities, including re-roofing two health centres in the poorest and most-affected neighbourhoods.\n\n**ZIMBABWE**\n\nCyclone Idai hit Chimanimani, a small district of approximately 30,000 people in Manicaland province, late Friday 15 March, after passing through Mozambique. Several roads leading into Chimanimani have been cut off, and the only access is by helicopter.\n     \n**Response**\n\nWe have sent an emergency response team to the mountainous areas of Manicaland province.\n\n**MALAWI**\n\nExtremely heavy rains in lower Shire River districts of Chikwawa and Nsanje, in Malawi\u2019s far south, has been compounded by further rains from last week\u2019s Cyclone Idai.\n\nThe rain has caused severe flooding in 14 of Nsanje\u2019s 28 districts. Official figures confirm over 50 deaths, and hundreds are injured. Rivers have broken their banks leaving many houses fully submerged, with 11,000 families in Nsanje have been displaced.\n\n**Response**\n\nWe have been responding to the floods for the last two weeks, responding in several areas with mobile clinics, and water and sanitation activities.",

Overall situation analysis**\n\nShelter damage assessment lead by the Government of Mozambique is ongoing. On the 21st March, the Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) from the National Operational Emergency Centre (CENOE) have identified 16,491 damaged houses to date. INGC continues to assess damage levels. The response remains in a Search and rescue phase.  \n\nFollowing the winds and flooding many people found shelter in evacuation centres. As of 21st march, 8996 Households (30574 people) were in evacuation centres.  \n\nBased on key informant interviews, many people are keen to return home and are requesting repair support materials including CGI.  \n\nAlthough there have been some returns, informal assessments indicate that approximately 2/3 suffered roofing damage the remaining 1/3 suffered entire structural failure. Wattle and daub structures were more vulnerable to wind damage. Fuller damage assessments are required to better classify the types of damage.\n\n**3.   Activity updates**\n\n- Initial distributions have started, albeit at a limited scale.\n\n- INGC assessments are ongoing.\n\n- Deliveries to Beira and other field locations to date from CVC (ICRC, IFRC, MRC), DFID/IOM, CHEMO consortium (world vision, FH, HI, Adra, caritas, Plan international, Helvetas), COSACA (CONCERN, Save The Children, OXFAM, CARE), PIROI/CVM \n\n- Additional confirmed deliveries to Beira before end October from Switzerland/IOM, Italy/IOM, SOS attitude, Electriciens Sans frontiers CVM/IFRC and CHEMO consortium.\n\n- CVM and Cosaca planning smaller deliveries to other hubs than Beira.\n\n- incoming flights DfID/IOM and PIROI/CVM were received in Beira.\n\n**4.

The Government of Mozambique (GoM) reported at least 281 confirmed deaths in the country as of March 22, with the numbers expected to rise significantly in the coming days. An estimated 1.7 million people were in the direct path of the cyclone, and 600,000 people are in need of urgent assistance or at risk due to continued flooding, according to the GoM. While Beira is reportedly 90 percent destroyed, there is a strong likelihood of greater destruction outside of the city.\n\n- On March 19, the GoM declared a national emergency due to the effects of the cyclone.  \nOn the same day, U.S. Ambassador to Mozambique Dennis W. Hearne declared a disaster due to the impact of the cyclone. On March 19, USAID/OFDA staff began arriving in Mozambique to support response effort; the following day, USAID activated a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to lead the USG response, as well as a Washington, D.C.-based Response Management Team (RMT) to support the DART.  \nThe DART and RMT are responding to the situation in coordination with other USG counterparts, GoM representatives, and humanitarian partners.\n\n- The DART plans to prioritize emergency food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions given the extensive needs identified in these sectors during initial assessments. As of March 22, USAID had provided $200,000 toward the humanitarian response to the cyclone in Mozambique and was communicating with humanitarian partners on the ground to determine additional needs. USAID is also working to dispatch relief commodities from the agency\u2019s warehouses in United Arab Emirates\u2019 city of Dubai and Italy\u2019s city of Pisa to Mozambique for distribution by humanitarian partners.",

A further 136 people are reportedly marooned, while more than 4,300 people are displaced, according to the Government. The death toll is expected to rise as areas previously cut-off become reachable by road and the full extent of the damage becomes known.  \n\nIn Chimanimani and Chipinge districts, at least half of the total population has been impacted, according to the preliminary findings of an inter-sector assessment mission which confirmed significant damage. Although not as badly hit, the districts of Buhera, Bikita, Chikomba, Gutu, Mutasa and Mutare have also sustained damage and many people have reportedly been displaced. At least 16,000 households have been displaced in Chimanimani (8,000), Mutare (4,000), Chipinge (3,000) and Buhera (1,000), according to the government.  \n\nAccess to clean water remains a key challenge. In Chimanimani, urban areas still have no water supply due to badly damaged infrastructure, while in Chipinge town supply lines from the dam were washed away. Damage to road infrastructure has cut people off from access to assistance and services in multiple locations, with bridges reportedly damaged at Hmandarume, Matsororo, Mvumvumvu, Biriri, Muusha Primary School and Nyahode.  \n\nThe Tongagora refugee camp\u2014which houses over 12,000 people\u2014has been affected by flooding. Some 1,100 shelters for 3,209 households have been completely or partially destroyed. Four out of five boreholes that supply the camp are out of commission due to power outages. Only one solar powered borehole is supplying water to the camp. More than 600 latrines in the camp have been destroyed.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n\u2022 The Government of Mozambique has formally requested international assistance.\n\n\u2022 The official death toll has risen to at least 242 people, according to the Government.\n\n\u2022 At least 65,000 people are sheltering in more than 100 collective sites across Sofala (73 sites), Manica (18), Zambezia (10) and Tete (4); the majority are staying in schools and churches.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 11,400 houses have been completely destroyed and crop losses are extensive\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW** \n\nThe Government of Mozambique has issued a Note Verbale formally requesting international assistance, including for all elements of the humanitarian response \u2013 food, shelter, education, health and non-food items, as well as logistical support, including air assets, boats and communications.  \n\nAt least 242 people have died and more than 1,400 have been injured in the aftermath of the Cyclone Idai weather system, according to the Government. The death toll is expected to continue to rise in the days ahead. Health and education facilities have suffered significant damage, with more than 2,800 classrooms and 39 health centres impacted by the cyclone and floods. More than 17,400 houses have been totally destroyed (11,025), partially destroyed (4,363) or flooded (2,056), according to government reports. In addition, more than 385,300 hectares of crops have been damaged, which will impact food security in the months ahead, particularly as the losses coincide with the annual harvest period.  \n\nOn 20 March, a multi-agency rapid needs assessment was conducted in Dondo District. People whose houses have been destroyed are accommodated in 28 reception centers (seven in Mafambisse, three in Mutua and 18 in Dondo), established in schools, according to local authorities. People in the centres expressed the intention to return home as soon as possible and requested to be supported with shelter material to rebuild their homes. The local authorities requested additional drug stocks, as health centres are reportedly running low. Health partners are concerned about the increased risk of respiratory infections and malaria cases, while acute watery diarrhea was also reported. Protection partners have highlighted the urgent need to separate sleeping arrangements in the reception centres, as different families are sleeping together, and this heightens the risk of gender-based violence. The teams observed many young children (below the age of 5 years).  \n\nIn Beira City, food prices have reportedly risen by about 300 per cent, with long queues observed for staples such as bread and fuel. Communication is slowly being restored with some towers and infrastructure fixed; providing data and voice access in some parts of the city. A communication centre has been established to ensure families can contact their relatives who were displaced or relocated during the floods. Beira remains only accessible by air and sea. The Caia-Beira road is not passable, and the Maputo-Beira road is not passable in Nhamatanda, as the road has been washed away at three points due to the broken dam. The city remains without electricity, while telephone and internet communication is intermittent.  \n\nSanitation and hygiene remain a concern, particularly in the reception centres, where cases of open defecation and poor use of limited facilities have been reported. Access to clean drinking water remains a challenge in all affected locations.  \n\nHealth partners have reported an increase in diarrhea cases and warned of the high risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria and respiratory infections.  \n\nBuzi District remains mostly submerged, although flood waters have began to recede in recent days. Many people from Buzi have been relocated through search and rescue to other areas. Access to safe drinking water is a top priority for rescued people as many of them are reportedly dehydrated after spending more than three days without food or water.",

Since 2018, Mozambique has been affected by acute food insecurity due to below-average and erratic rainfall.   \n\nTo date, as many as 29,613 people have been displaced in Malawi and Mozambique, seeking refuge in neighbouring areas. It is estimated that around half of all displaced persons are women and adolescents.\n \nIn Malawi, a total of 468,650 people have been affected by the floods and 30 have reportedly died. Two health facilities in the affected districts have been submerged in water and 377 people were reportedly injured. Of the affected population, it was estimated that around 117,160 were women of childbearing age and around 23,432 were pregnant. \n\nThe Mozambican National Institute of Meteorology issued an alert on 16 March that heavy rains and strong winds were expected in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Tete, Inhambane and Gaza. This would worsen the situation in the central provinces, putting a greater number of people at risk and more of a burden on those already suffering from the flood and cyclone Idai. \n\nAn estimated 600,000 people were severely impacted by Idai, including about 141,000 people already affected by the preceding tropical depression and flooding earlier this month, during which 66 deaths and 111 injuries were reported, and more than 17,100 people were sheltered in 10 transit centres.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, tens of thousands of people were reportedly affected by the cyclone, with confirmed reports of more than 80 fatalities and 100 missing, and hundreds of houses, bridges, schools and roads washed away by flash floods and mudslides, especially in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts of Manicaland province. A high number of residents have reportedly been displaced.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n- More than 100 deaths have been reported, more than 200 people have been injured and over 200 are still reported missing.\n\n- Marowanyati Dam in Murambinda has overflowed, raising water levels in Mwerahari River. People living along the river have been advised to be on high alert.\n\n- Chimanimani and Chipinge remain the hardest-hit districts, with access still problematic, especially in Chimanimani.\n\n- Crops and livestock have been destroyed in both districts, which were already facing Crisis levels of food insecurity.\n\n- Power supply and communications are disrupted in affected areas. Water supply infrastructure has also been damaged and Chipinge town is without access to clean water. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW** \n\nThe flooding caused by the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system since 15 March continues to cause destruction in Zimbabwe, although rains have begun to dissipate in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces. \n\nAt least 102 deaths and over 200 injuries have been reported, mainly in Chimanimani, and 217 people are reportedly still missing. These figures are expected to rise in the days ahead as the full extent of the damage and loss of life becomes known. At least 923 homes have been destroyed in Chimanimani, Mutasa, Mutare, Chipinge, Buhera, Chikomba, Gutu and Bikita districts. In Chimanimani alone, eight bridges have been destroyed. In Buhera, the Marowanyati dam has overflowed and many families are displaced. People living along the Mwerahari River have been advised to be on high alert. The Tongagora refugee camp has been affected by flooding, and 49 households have been relocated within the camp. \n\nThe hardest-hit district of Chimanimani remains inaccessible, as do several wards in Chipinge district. Heavy rains have damaged roads and main access bridges have been washed away. Water supply stations have been affected, particularly in Manicaland, including Murambinda, Nyanga, Mutasa, Checheche, Biriwiri, Chibuwe, Chakohwa, Nyanyadzi, Berzely Bridge and Buhera. In Masvingo, water stations affected include Gutu, Zaka, Mutimurefu and Ngundu. \n\nCrops and livestock have been destroyed in all affected areas, which were already facing rising food insecurity. Both Chimanimani and Chipinge were classified in Crisis (IPC phase 3) and Buheira was facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) prior to this new loss of crops caused by the Cyclone Idai weather system. \n\nOverall, more than 2,500 households (12,500 to 15,000 people) are estimated to be affected. However, an accurate assessment of the number of people impacted and displaced is still difficult to establish at this point, as many district wards remain inaccessible. As the heavy rains subside, the full extent of the cyclone\u2019s impact and response required will become clearer in the coming days. \n\nThe displacement of people, together with damaged water supply infrastructure, heightens the risk of malaria, cholera and other diarrheal diseases and the potential for a communicable disease outbreak. Government and operational partners are closely monitoring. \n\nMeanwhile, damage to the port in Beira and its access roads in neighbouring Mozambique may affect fuel and food supplies to Zimbabwe, as well as livelihoods of people in eastern Zimbabwe that rely heavily on the Zimbabwe/Mozambique trading corridor. \n\n**RESPONSE**     \n\nThe Government-led response is being coordinated by the Department of Civil Protection (DCP) through the National, Provincial and District Civil Protection Committees, with support from humanitarian partners. Coordination meetings are ongoing at national, provincial and district levels in Manicaland.    \n\nThe Government has announced that they have allocated $RTGS 50 million for emergency response and infrastructure rehabilitation. Helicopter rescue operations are underway, and the police sub-aqua unit has been deployed. Military personnel are proceeding by foot towards where roads have been destroyed.    \n\nWorking with district authorities, humanitarian actors have deployed teams to the worst-affected areas. Relief trucks carrying shelter, non-food items and WASH supplies have arrived, and distribution is underway in Mutare. The Government has reportedly dispatched medical supplies to Mutare, but access constraints are hampering re-supply to district clinics. WFP has pre-positioned food stocks ready to deploy and other agencies are mobilising in-country and regional stocks, particularly for health and WASH interventions. IOM dispatched 1,000 tarpaulins and 200 non-food item kits for the initial response in Manicaland. However, these are yet to be distributed because of bad weather. Three engineering companies deployed equipment to Tangana on 18 March and have started work on roads in collaboration with local authorities. The Zimbabwean public is also responding, and collection centres have been set up in Harare and Bullawayo.    \n\nJoint rapid needs assessments are ongoing, covering Chimanimani, Chipinge, Mutare, Nyanga and Buhera, and should report preliminary findings this week",

An estimated 260,000 children have reportedly been affected, according to UNICEF, and are in desperate conditions.    \n\nThe situation is likely to deteriorate, and the number of people affected is likely to increase, as weather experts predict heavy rainfall in Sofala and Manica provinces from 19 to 21 March. Flood waters may rise up to around eight metres and at least 350,000 people are at risk, according to media reports quoting the President. There are also growing concerns regarding the potential effects of the overflow of the Marowanyati Dam in Zimbabwe on water levels in Mozambique.    \n\nOn 18 March, Government officials and representatives from the humanitarian community conducted an aerial survey of Buzi area \u2013 home to more than 200,000 people - after reports that the Buzi and Pungwe rivers had burst their banks. Thousands of people were reportedly marooned on rooftops and an aerial survey showed that more than 50 kilometers of land in Buzi town had been submerged. The immediate priority is search and rescue for people stranded and isolated by flood waters, with priority being given to trauma victims.   \n\nMain roads into and out of Beira remain cut due to flood waters and extensive damage to the road network. Meanwhile, the Beira Central Hospital remains only partially functional due to damage sustained during Cyclone Idai and other clinics in surrounding areas are also reportedly not functioning. \n\n**RESPONSE**    \n\nSearch and rescue operations are scaling-up. The Indian Navy and the South African Air Force are supporting Government-led efforts to evacuate survivors from Buzi to Beira. Barges and small boats are being used to gather people at designated points, from where they can be evacuated to accommodation centres in Beira Port. An alert has been sent through the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) to mobilise additional search and rescue capacity, particularly teams with floods response experience.    \n\nWFP continues to carry-out airlifts of high-energy biscuits and other vital supplies from Beira. An additional four tonnes of biscuits were due to be delivered to Beira on 19 March, in addition to the 1.2 tonnes dispatched on 18 March. Emergency Telecommunication (ETC) partners have deployed ICT equipment and T\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8re is providing connectivity at Beira airport to support the humanitarian community in the affected areas. The Crisis Connectivity Charter has also been formerly activated for the first time, with Eutelsat and Imarsat providing additional satellite connectivity equipment to support efforts on the ground. Ethanol producer, Greenfuel has deployed earth-moving machinery for the repair of the damaged Tanganda-Chipinge road. The damage was reportedly as result of poor drainage and the company has deployed machinery for clearing the debris before moving to other affected areas, including Chimanimani area.    \n\nOn 19 March, 7,550 shelter kits and 100 family tents funded by UKaid arrived in Mozambique. The kits can provide emergency shelter for up to 38,000 people. DFID has also provided immediate funds to WFP to provide food for two weeks to 120,000 people. USAID has deployed a disaster expert to assess the damage and identify priority needs, while ECHO has released \u20ac2 million to support rapid response in Mozambique.",

    "body": "Since the publication of the ACAPS Malawi Floods Briefing Note on 12 March, severe flooding has continued in southern and central regions of Malawi. In total, an estimated 922,900 people have been affected across 14 districts, with 56 deaths and 577 injuries reported and more than 125,000 displaced. The number of people reported as being affected by flooding has increased by more than 450,000 since the last ACAPS report. This trend can likely be attributed in part to the impact of Cyclone Idai, which has exacerbated rainfall across Malawi, and potentially to new information becoming available. Response gaps include shelter, food, health, and WASH. There is an elevated risk that rain linked to Tropical Cyclone Idai will persist in southern and central regions of Malawi, which will likely continue to drive humanitarian needs in flood-affected areas.",

    "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- The death toll from Cyclone Idai\u2019s landfall has reportedly risen to at least 84 and the President has said that it could rise above 1,000, according to media reports.\n\n- Heavy rainfall is projected to continue in Sofala and Manica provinces from 19 to 21 March.\n\n- Alerts have been issued regarding the risk of flooding in the Buzi and Pungoe river basins in the next 72 hours, which could lead to further destruction and potential loss of life.\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nAt least 84 people have died following Cyclone Idai\u2019s landfall, and the President of Mozambique, Filipe Nyusi, has said that he believes the death toll could be higher than 1,000 people, according to media reports. At least 267 classrooms and 24 health units have reportedly been affected in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Inhambane, according to authorities. Many areas remain without power and almost every network has been damaged.\n\nBeira City has suffered extensive damage, according to reports from preliminary assessments and aerial overviews. The Beira Central Hospital emergency wing remains non-operational due to significant damage. However, other parts of the hospital \u2013 including the paediatric wing \u2013 have sustained less damage and are reportedly functioning. The Munhava District health center in Beira City has also sustained damage, with the roof reportedly collapsed. WFP\u2019s office and warehouse in Beira were damaged, but some of its stocks \u2013 including ready-to-use nutritious food for malnourished children and women \u2013 have been salvaged. The Population Services International (PSI) factory in Beira was also reportedly damaged, impacting WASH supplies, including stocks of certeza, a water purifier.\n\nBeira City remains cut-off from surrounding areas, with the N6 national road between Tica and Nhamatanda (85 kilometres from Beira) now impassable. Parts of Beira Port \u2013 including the grain terminal, warehouses and coal terminal \u2013 sustained damage. However, the container terminal and oil terminal did not sustain any major damage, according to preliminary reports. Several vessels ran aground near the Port and salvage operations are underway to clear the area.\n\nOutside of Beira, a dam collapsed on 17 March, reportedly causing extensive damage. People reportedly sought refuge on the tops of their roofs and trees as rising floodwaters swept through the area. Initial aerial surveys indicated significant loss of life, although exact numbers of people impacted are not yet known.\n\nIn Manica Province, there are reports of thousands of people affected by flooding and many areas remain inaccessible, making it difficult to identify the scale of impact and needs. A bridge has reportedly collapsed, isolating Dombe and Munhinga, in Sussundenga, from the rest of Manica province.\n\nThe next 72 hours are expected to be critical, with water expected to rise above alert levels in the Buzi and Pungoe river basins and a continued high risk of urban floods in Beira and Dondo. Meanwhile, thousands of people in Zambezia and Tete remain in need of assistance following floods that began in early March.\n\n**RESPONSE**\n\nIn Beira, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) is maintaining its Center of Operations at the airport, with inter-agency coordination currently being facilitated by WFP and COSACA. Telecoms Sans Frontiers has deployed a team to Beira and has established connectivity for humanitarian operations. OCHA has deployed surge staff on the ground who are supporting inter-agency coordination. A second coordination hub is being established in Chimoio, led by INGC, to support operations in surrounding areas and a coordination meeting was held on 18 March to discuss critical issues. Coordination is also active in Quelimane in Zambezia, led by the INGC with support from UNICEF.\n\nResponse and search and rescue efforts are underway in multiple areas. INGC is providing assistance to 3,800 families in accommodation centers in Sofala Province.WFP has begun distributions in Beira and multiple health partners are supporting urgent response in impacted health facilities, including Beira Central Hospital. Outside of Beira, response is ongoing in Zambezia, including to contain the vaccine-derived polio outbreak which was confirmed in January 2019. In Tete City, WFP is assisting nearly 900 families affected by flooding with a mixture of cash transfer and vouchers assistance, at the INGC accommodation center in Matundo neighborhood, involving local food retailers.\n\nFour helicopters \u2013 three government and one from WFP \u2013 are supporting the response in-country. WFP airlifted 20 tonnes of high energy biscuits into Beira on 17 March to assist more than 22,000 people. A flight from the Dubai Humanitarian Response Depot carrying vital supplies - including 13,700 tarps, 3,500 jerry cans, 1,500 shelter tool kits and medicines for UN and NGO operations - was due to land in Maputo on 18 March, and additional food supplies are arriving in the coming days. Efforts are underway to move supplies by boat from the Maputo Port to the Beira Port in the coming days.\n\nHowever, significant response challenges remain. The scale and scope of flooding has made multiple key roads impassable, meaning that road convoys are not able to reach Beira at this time. Many trucks are therefore stuck on the road and unable to reach their intended destinations. There are also challenges flying sufficient relief supplies into Beira and surrounding areas due to the limited number of air assets currently available for the operation.",

In Chimanimani alone, eight bridges have been destroyed. In Buhera, the Marowanyati dam has overflowed and many families are displaced. Crops and livestock have been destroyed in all affected areas. Overall, more than 2,500 households (12,500 to 15,000 people) are estimated to be affected. However, an accurate assessment of the number of people impacted and displaced is difficult to establish at this point, as many district wards remain inaccessible.\n\nMeanwhile, damage to the port in Beira and its access roads in neighbouring Mozambique may affect fuel and food supplies to Zimbabwe, as well as livelihoods of people in the eastern regions of the country that rely heavily on the Zimbabwe/Mozambique trading corridor.",

    "body": "**Overview**\n\nThis Weekly Bulletin focuses on selected acute public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 65 events in the region. This week\u2019s edition covers key new and ongoing events, including:\n\n- Flooding in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe \n- Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n- Measles in Chad \n- Humanitarian crisis in Democratic Republic of the Congo.  \n\nFor each of these events, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided.  \n\nA table is provided at the end of the bulletin with information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have largely been controlled and thus closed.  \n\n**Major issues and challenges include:**  \n\n- The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. Currently, the greatest concern remains transmission in the neighbouring urban areas of Katwa and Butembo, which contribute about three-quarters of all recent cases. The two hotspots have been responsible for recrudescence of infections to areas where transmission had been contained. The response teams need to pay particular attention on Katwa and Butembo, without losing focus on the other areas to avoid potential recurrence of cases in those areas that have already contained the disease.  \n- Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe have been devasted by severe flooding and strong winds as a result of the tropical cyclone Idai. The full impact of the cyclone is yet to be established, however, initial reports indicate loss of life and significant damage to infrastructure. While measurable disaster preparedness measures were put in place prior to the event, the magnitude of the impact of the cyclone is simply overwhelming. There is a need to support the affected countries to address the immediate life-saving humanitarian needs as well as medium-to-long term recovery programmes.",

    "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- The death toll from Cyclone Idai\u2019s landfall has reportedly risen to at least 48 and is expected to increase in the days ahead as the full extent of the disaster becomes known.\n\n- Widespread damage is reported in Beira City, with concerns that the situation outside the City may be worse.\n\n- The President of Mozambique is visiting cyclone- and floodaffected areas in Sofala, Zambezia and Manica.\n\n- Road access to many affected areas has been cut due to flooding.\n\n- Authorities have issued a Red Alert for flooding along the River Buzi, with a high risk of floods in Buzi and Pungo\u00e9.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nAt least 48 people have died following Cyclone Idai\u2019s landfall, according to unverified media reports, and the death toll is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information becomes available.  \n\nThere has been significant damage to houses in Beira City \u2013 which has an estimated population of more than half a million people - according to initial information. Health and education facilities have also been damaged, with preliminary reports indicating that the Beira Central Hospital emergency room has been flooded and is without power, while much of the roof of the building has collapsed. Power lines and trees are reportedly down in many parts of the city. In addition, it has been reported that areas outside of the city may have been even more intensely impacted by the storm.  \n\nMassive destruction of livestock and planted crops has been reported. As this damage is occurring just before the main harvest season, it could exacerbate food insecurity in the region.  \n\nThe Government has issued a Red Alert for flooding along the River Buzi. The alert highlights the high risk of floods in Buzi and Pungo\u00e9 and the potential for Buzu, Nhamatanda, Dondo, Muanza and Chinababava to be affected. Heavy rains are forecast for the next 24 hours, including in areas already hit hard by the trajectory of the Cyclone Idai weather system during and after landfall.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe President of Mozambique, Filipe Nyusi, is visiting multiple flood and cyclone-affected areas to meet with people impacted, including in the districts of Dondo and Nhamatanda in Sofala, Chinde and Maganja da Costa in Zambezia, the provincial capital and districts of Moatize and Changara in Tete, and the city of Chimoio in Manica, according to media reports. He is traveling with multiple senior government officials, including the Minister of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources, Jo\u00e3o Machatine, and the governors of the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica, as well as the Director of the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), amongst others.  \n\nIn Beira, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) has set up its Center of Operations in a WFP-provided Wikhall at the airport, with inter-agency coordination currently being facilitated by WFP and the NGO Consortium (COSACA). Telecoms Sans Frontiers has deployed a team to Beira and is establishing connectivity for the operations centre.\n\nResponse efforts are underway in multiple areas. In Beira Central Hospital, remaining health workers are working shifts in order to treat emergency patients as best they can. WFP is supporting logistics, including through the contracting of an MI-8 transport helicopter, due to arrive on 18 March, to conduct emergency air operations focusing on remote locations that are inaccessible by road. WFP has also funded 30 boat pilots that were mobilized by the INGC to transport food during the response. An inter-agency flight with humanitarian supplies from the Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai is scheduled to arrive in Maputo on 18 March.  \n\nMultiple convoys are en route to Beira with vital relief items and assessments are ongoing in the city. However, teams endeavouring to reach Beira and surrounding areas by road are facing challenges, as the main road routes have been cut due to flooding.  \n\nIn the coming days, WFP plans to assist 22,000 people in hard to reach areas with a 3-day ration of high energy biscuits.  In addition, 6,600 persons in Caia and surrounding areas can be assisted with the prepositioned 50MT of food in that hub and approximately 100,000 people will be assisted with 800 tons of in-country commodities pre-positioned in Nacala (borrowed from other programmes), with 75 tons dispatched on 16 March to support 9,500 people living in accommodation centers in Zambezia province. On 16 March, WFP made its first distribution to 6,000 flood affected persons in Tete through cash-based transfers, engaging with local retailers.",

The storm caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts causing riverine and flash flooding and subsequent deaths, destruction of livelihoods and properties. \n \nAreas within the pathway of Cyclone Idai\u2019s weather system include Manicaland, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West, and parts of Masvingo and Midlands provinces, according to the Metrological Services Department. Its effects are also projected to be felt in Harare Metropolitan and the Matabeleland provinces. Chimanimani and Chipinge districts have been hardest-hit, with riverine and flash flooding reported. The town of Chimanimani was reportedly cut off after bridges across Mvumvumvu River (Matsororo and Muusha bridges) along the Mutare-Chimanimani Highway were washed away and other sections of road were blocked by fallen trees and landslides. Power supply in many areas is affected.  \n\nAt least 31 deaths have been reported and over 100 people are missing, according to preliminary information. The death toll may rise in the days ahead as further information regarding the storm\u2019s impact becomes available.  \n\nAt least 1,600 households (8,000 to 9,600 people) have been affected in Chimanimani, Chipinge, Nyanga and Mutare districts, Manicaland Province, as a result of flooding and landslides, according to initial information.

The cyclone brought torrential rains and winds to Sofala, Zambezia,  Manica and Inhambane provinces.  \n\nBeira and other districts of Sofala province are facing power and communication outages, according to initial reports from the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) and Directorate of Analysis and Weather Forecast (DAPT). Several villages have been cut off from the mainland by tidal surge, according to media reports.  \n\nThe full extent of the damage caused by Cyclone Idai\u2019s landfall is not yet known. However, preliminary information indicates that destruction and interruption of services are highly likely, including: 1) damage to schools and health facilities, including materials and supplies; 2) damages to crops, including about 168,000 hectares of crops already impacted by flooding in early March, which will undermine food security and nutrition, including amongst the most vulnerable people already affected by the earlier floods and drought; 3) water supply destruction and interruption due to heavy winds and floods; 4) heightened risk of water borne diseases due to damage to sanitation facilities and prevalence of unsafe water; 5) destruction of houses and loss of non-food items; and 6) heightened protection risks, particularly for women and children, including increased risk of gender-based violence and possible displacement.  \n\nThe cyclone is expected to be weakening, and winds to reduce from 140 km/h to at least 70 km/h by the afternoon of 15 March and continue its movement towards Manica province as a Tropical Depression. \n \nRESPONSE \n\nAn inter-agency team, led by the INGC Director, is moving towards Beira to assess the situation and is expected to arrive in the evening of 15 March.  \n\nThe [UN and humanitarian partners in Mozambique have appealed for US$40.8 million](https://reliefweb.int/node/3037163/) to provide critical emergency relief to 400,000 people who are estimated to be affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai, based on projections of people living in the Cyclone\u2019s path.  \n\nIn order to kick-start the emergency response, the UN and NGOs have prioritized the most time-critical life-saving activities in the education, health, WASH, food security, protection and nutrition sectors. Several organizations have deployed staff from Headquarters and the region to support the in-country response. The logistics sector has been activated and will provide one helicopter for an initial period of four weeks to reach inaccessible areas with life-saving assistance. The cluster is also facilitating storage space and road transport between Maputo, Biera, Nampula to Caia or Quelimane. WFP has transported 20 tonnes of high energy biscuits, which are due to arrive in country imminently.",

The overall objective of the operation is to meet the immediate shelter, WASH and health needs of 1,500 households (7,500 people) affected by flooding and incoming Cyclone IDAI in Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, and Tete provinces of Mozambique. Hygiene promotion will, however, allow the operation to reach the totality of displaced households which amounts to 17,095 people (3,419 households) currently sheltered in accommodation centres.  \n\nMozambique is a country prone to hydrological disasters which normally have severe impact on the country\u2019s population and infrastructure. On 9 March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai formed over the Northern Mozambique Channel and is predicted to make landfall through Sofala province with Intense Tropical Cyclone category on 15 March 2019. In recent days, severe flooding has impacted Zambezia, Tete, and Niassa provinces and by 12 March 2019, fifteen people were already reported dead from the effects of the floods, while 103,169 (approximately 20,633 households) have been affected. As mentioned above, more than 17,095 people (3,419 households) are currently displaced and are being sheltered in 15 transit centres (11 in Zambezia, 2 in Tete and 2 in Niassa). Zambezia province has been hardest hit out of the three provinces impacted so far.\n\nAs of 13 March, meteorological services announced that the situation is set to worsen in the coming days. Indeed, the windspeed of Idai will be between 188-220 km/h and is expected to release rainfall above 150 mm within 24 hours. At its peak intensity, Idai's strength may be equal to a Category 4 hurricane. The expected heavy rain could further affect Zambezia and Sofala provinces, which will exacerbate an already dire flood crisis. National water resources authorities alert that at least 160,000 people are at risk of flooding due to forecasted heavy rains in the coming days in Zambezi, Licungo, Buzi and Pungoe river basins. Initial estimates from the Mozambique Government anticipate that USD $18 million will be required for food and non-food items on the potential response to population at risk.\n\nWith flooding already affecting tens of thousands of people and Cyclone Idai expected to imminently make landfall, with the potential to cause further destruction and displacement, Mozambique Red Cross (CVM) seeks support from the IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to preposition materials needed to respond and to anticipate urgent needs on the ground. This will enable the CVM to respond to the projected flooding as well as to replenish materials that have already been distributed to the affected families as part of their early actions. The DREF will also ensure that the NS has resources to conduct detailed assessments of the needs on the ground which will in-turn inform any strategy changes in the operation.",

    "body": "**Highlights**\n\n\u2022 The Coordinating Council of Disaster Management activated on 11 March the Institutional Red Alert for the central region of the country;\n\n\u2022 Government estimated US$ 18 million for food and nonfood items that might be needed for the potential response of population at risk;\n\n\u2022 At least 15 deaths reported, and 103,169 people were affected by the floods in Zamb\u00e9zia, Tete and Niassa provinces;\n\n\u2022 At least 17,095 people are displaced in Zambezia, Tete and Niassa sheltered in 15 transit centers;\n\n\u2022 At least 84,993 ha of crop area are flooded affecting 57,819 smallholder farmers;\n\n\u2022 Intense Tropical Cyclone IDAI active in Mozambique channel and land fall expected on 15 March;\n\n\u2022 National water resources authorities alert that at least 160,000 people are at risk of flooding and heavy rains in the coming days in Zambezi, Licungo, Buzi and Pungoe river basins;\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nOn 11 March 2019, the Government convened the Coordinating Council of Disaster Management (CCGC-the highest political level of emergency coordination in Mozambique) chaired by the Prime-Minister to analyze the impact of the recent floods and the cyclone foreseen to make the landfall on 15 March 2019. This meeting was extended to Provincial Governors of affected provinces, Humanitarian Country Team and National directors of different sectors.  \n\nIn the CCGC meeting the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) informed that in the next 14 days it is foreseen weak to moderate and locally heavy rainfall in several areas of the country mainly in Sofala, Zamb\u00e9zia and Manica where the rainfall will be between 200-300 mm due to Tropical cyclone IDAI. The cyclone will approach the Mozambique channel and will landfall through Sofala province with Intense Tropical Cyclone category most likely on 15 March 2019. The speed wind will be between 188-220 km/h and rainfall above 150 mm in 24h.  \n\nMoreover, the Water resources authorities indicated that due to flood wave caused by heavy rains in the upstream part of the Zambeze region it is expected water levels of 8m in Caia and Marromeu districts in Sofala province resulting in flooding in the area. The authorities prepared three flood scenarios depending on the rainfall and discharge to be recorded which the population at risk varies from 85,000 to 221,000 people in the Zambezi basin.  \n\nTherefore, in the next 3 days it is expected the rise of water level that may overcome the alert level in the Licungo, Zambeze, Pungoe and Buzi river basins. The operation status of the defense dykes in these basins is very bad which makes the area more vulnerable. It is also foreseen moderate to high urban flooding in Quelimane, Beira and Dondo where about 13,000 people are at risk. Based on the forecast, the Pungoe river basin might reach the peak of 5,000 m3 /s causing floods in the districts of Nhamatanda, Muanza and Dondo where an estimated 25,250 people are at risk. The authorities also expect damages in at least eleven road sections in these four river basins.  \n\nGiven the current and expected situation after the floods and cyclone, the National Institute of Disaster Management estimated a total funding requirement of about US$ 18 million for food and non-food items that might be needed for the potential affected people. This funding estimate does not include the funds needed for emergency road work (estimated at US$ 13.9 million) to reset the road network which is 31% damaged in Zamb\u00e9zia and 50% damaged in Cabo Delgado.  \n\nAs the situation is complex and resources are limited, the Government activated the Institutional Red alert (the maximum alert level for emergency response in the country) to enable operation at full capacity, mobilize additional resources, compulsory withdrawal of population at risk among other activities.",

    "title": "Malawi - Floods Briefing note \u2013 12 March 2019",
    "body": "Heavy rains over 5-8 March caused flooding in the Southern region of Malawi (Floodlist 8/3/2019; OCHA 9/3/2019). As of 10 March, at least 14 districts have been impacted, affecting approximately 468,650 people and displacing more than 31,700 people. At least 30 people have been killed and over 370 injured. Assessments are ongoing. (Xinhua 11/3/2019; Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) 10/3/2019). On 8 March, the president declared a state of disaster in the areas affected by ongoing rain and flooding (OCHA 9/3/2019). Priority needs are shelter, WASH, food, livelihood and health assistance.\n\n**Anticipated scope and scale**\n\nMachinga and Zomba districts are among the worst hit, with more than 50,000 people affected per district, followed by Ntcheu, Phalombe, Nsanje and Blantyre City district (OCHA 11/3/2019). More rainfall and thunderstorms are expected, which will worsen the flood situation (ECHO 10/3/2019). The coping capacity of the affected population is limited, especially among refugees, due to the impact of previous floods in 2019 and dry spells in 2018. Food shortages and anticipated reduced harvest will likely extend the ongoing lean season (FEWS NET 11/3/2019). There is a high risk of cholera or diarrhoea due to inadequate WASH facilities. A lack of mosquito nets increases the risk of widespread vector-borne diseases (Nyasa Times 11/3/2019; IRCR 11/2/2019).\n\n**Key priorities**\n\n+31,700  \npeople displaced  \n+468,650   \npeople affected     \nInterventions urgently needed   \nto prevent disease outbreaks  \n\n**Humanitarian constraints**\n\nAccess is severely restricted in flood-affected areas, in particular along the east banks of Shire river. Helicopters and boats are used to reach many rural affected communities. Ongoing power outages will likely further affect operations.\n\n**Crisis impact**\n\nOver 5-8 March heavy rains in southern and central parts of Malawi caused flooding and rivers to overflow, affecting at least 468,650 people (93,730 households) across 14 districts (OCHA 9/3/2018; Reuters 10/3/2019; Flood List 8/3/2019; DoDMA 11/3/2019). Machinga and Zomba districts have been most impacted, accounting for more than 50,000 affected people per district. Some 25,000 - 50,000 people have also been affected in each of the districts of Ntcheu, Phalombe and Nsanje and an estimated 10,000 - 25,000 people have been affected in Mwanza, Chiwawa, Blantyre, Balaka and Mulanje districts (OCHA 11/3/2019). Affected population estimates from other districts are not available. A minimum of 31,700 people (6,341 households) are displaced. At least 30 people have lost their lives and over 370 people have been injured as a result of the floods and buildings collapsing. An unknown number of people remain missing. (DoDMA 11/3/2019; Xinhua 11/3/2019; Burunga 11/3/2019; OCHA 11/3/2019)\n\nThe number of people reported affected, injured, and dead is likely to increase over the coming days, as results from assessments are made available. The numbers are also likely to increase as heavy rain and thunderstorms following Tropical Cyclone Idai are forecast to continue. (Fewsnet 8/3/2019; Xinhua 11/3/2019; Al Jazeera 11/3/2019; ECHO 10/3/2019). People\u2019s coping capacity is limited as it has been raining heavily in the same area since the end of January. Renewed rains in March marked an increase in level of precipitation compared to previous rainfall in 2019, following tropical disturbances which fell across the northern Mozambique channel at beginning of March (Xinhua 11/3/2019; Manila Bulletin 11/3/2019; GoM 9/3/2019).\n\n**Shelter**: An estimated 31,700 people (6,341 households), including many refugees residing in camps, are displaced. Most are estimated to need emergency shelter, however information remains unclear as an actual count did not happen (DoDMA 11/3/2019). In Blantyre, around 1,400 houses have collapsed (MANA News Agency 11/3/2019). Many displaced people have found refuge in makeshift sites in schools and churches (GoM 10/03/2019). The number of displaced people is likely to increase as more buildings are at risk of collapsing due to continuing rains and flooding. Evacuation is ongoing. The total number of people evacuated is unclear; however, they are most likely included in the total number displaced. A local newspaper reported that the local government in Mulanje district commissioned 27 evacuation camps for those affected by flooding in the district (MANA News Agency 11/3/2019).\n\nSome dams built to prevent flooding have collapsed, leaving many communities inundated (MANA News Agency 11/3/2019; Burunga 11/3/2019).\n\nFurther information about the displaced population, and the geographical whereabouts of the affected and displaced people, as well as a gender/age-segregated breakdown, is lacking.\n\n**WASH**: The water supply has been impacted by rain and flooding (OCHA 9/3/2019). Contamination forms a high risk. Displaced people are reported to have no or only very limited access to clean and safe drinking water nor adequate WASH facilities (GoM 11/3/2019). Chlorine to treat drinking water is lacking (Manila Bulletin 11/3/2019).\n\n**Food**: Most of the affected families, and the displaced population in particular, need food. Local media reports food shortages in refugee camps (Burunga 11/3/2019; MANA News Agency 11/3/2019). Many households\u2019 food reserves have been destroyed or damaged, crops have been washed away and livestock lost (Nyasa Times 10/3/2019; Xinhua 11/3/2019; Burunga 11/3/2019; Manila Bulletin 11/3/2019; GoM 10/03/2019). The extent of damage and losses is unclear. However it is expected that the 2018/2019 food harvest, normally accessible in early April, will be limited due to fewer crops, and food security levels among people affected might be impacted negatively in the upcoming months. This might possibly extend the 2019 lean season (typically from November to February) (CIA Factbook 8/2/2019; FEWS NET 11/3/2019).\n\nCurrently affected districts are facing Stressed level (IPC Phase 2) and nutrition levels will further deteriorate (FEWS NET 11/3/2019). Fewer jobs in agricultural production will be available, reducing purchasing power countrywide and limited access to available and affordable food (FEWS NET 11/3/2019).\n\nDue to dry spells in 2018, in the southern districts in particular, the maize harvest in 2017/2018 was lower than average, affecting mostly poor households, whose food stocks got depleted. Their coping strategies to respond to renewed harvest losses is severely limited as they are already relying on market purchases and humanitarian assistance to access goods. The maize price in the southern districts is already 8% higher than the 5-year average and is likely to rise further facing potentially reduced harvest 2019 (FEWS NET 11/3/2019).",

At least 13 districts have been impacted, with Nsanje (more than 44,500 people affected) and Phalombe (25,000 people affected) hardest hit.  \n\nAccording to initial reports, at least 115,000 people have been affected. This includes at least 23 people killed, 29 injured and at least 12 reported missing. These numbers are expected to rise in the days ahead as assessment teams reach additional areas and further information becomes available.  \n\nElectricity and water supplies have been impacted by the rains and floods. The Electricity Generation Company (EGENCO) has said that around 270 megawatts of Malawi's 320 megawatts of available hydropower capacity was offline, according to media reports. \n\n**RESPONSE** \n\nOn 8 March 2019, the President of Malawi, His Excellency Arthur Peter Mutharika, declared a State of Disaster in areas hit by the heavy rains and floods in the country. The President directed the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA) under the Ministry of Homeland Security to urgently mobilize and coordinate emergency relief services to those affected and also directed the Malawi Defence Force (MDF) to quickly move in and assist those trapped and displaced by the floods and the heavy rains. He also called upon individuals and organisations -both local and international- to join the Government in providing relief to affected Malawians.  \n\nDODMA has deployed search and rescue teams, in collaboration with the MDF, Malawi Police Service, Malawi Red Cross Society and affected district councils. DODMA has also deployed 23 trucks of relief items to be distributed in affected districts, including tents, plastic sheets, maize, rice, beans, blankets and kitchen utensils, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Homeland Security on 8 March. An Inter-Agency Assessment Committee is due to deploy on 10 March to Nsanje and Phalombe to conduct further needs assessments. WFP has deployed two boats to accompany the assessment and response, UNICEF is providing drones, FAO/WFP will support mapping using satellite imagery and OCHA is deploying a staff member to support assessments and response.",
