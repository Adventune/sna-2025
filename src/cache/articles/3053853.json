                "body": "**Background** \n\nOn the evening of Thursday 14 March Category 3 Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Beira, Mozambique’s fourth largest city, bringing high wind speeds of up to 224 km per hour and heavy rains. The cyclone followed extensive flooding throughout the Mozambique provinces of Zambézia, Tete and Niassa in early March. Ongoing assessments are being undertaken by government officials and humanitarian workers to determine immediate needs, however significant infrastructure damage has been reported, with heavy rainfall over a number of days has causing damage to road and bridges, and interrupting regular supply routes. Sofala province is expected to be the worst affected. There are also growing concerns regarding the potential effects of the overflow of the Marowanyati Dam in Zimbabwe on water levels in Mozambique, which could lead to further deterioration of roads and infrastructure (OCHA). \n\nThe Government of Mozambique (GoM) has declared a state of national emergency and requested international assistance. The National Disaster Management Agency (INGC) is leading the response. The Logistics Cluster was activated on 20 March. WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has been requested by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) to provide coordination and information management support, and facilitate access of common logistics services to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver life-saving items across affected areas.\n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks** \n\nThe cyclone path has seriously damaged logistics infrastructures across the affected areas including warehouses, ports, airports, roads and bridges. Until 24 March, Beira is currently only accessible via sea and air. This includes the main supply route from Beira to Harare (Zimbabwe) via Chimoio, where bridges have reportedly collapsed and parts the road remain flooded. An 18 March aerial survey of the Buzi area showed more than 50 km of land in Buzi town had been submerged. Moreover, several roads north of Caia in the Zambézia province remain impassable. Given high water levels, road access will continue to remain a key challenge to access affected populations. This is further hindered by the local market’s limited capacity to provide specific truck types suitable for such conditions. \n\nIn relation to storage, the cyclone has caused extensive damage to infrastructure. In Beira operational warehousing will remain limited until rehabilitation work is complete and cargo stored in damaged warehouses will have to be transferred. It is anticipated that available storage capacity will be fully occupied in the coming days. Temporary storage solutions such as Mobile Storage Units (MSU) will be required until impacted infrastructure returns to operational use.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the major logistics constraints limiting humanitarian operations in Sofala, Manica and Zambézia Provinces of Mozambique currently are:\n\n• A lack of available storage capacity (Beira and Chimoio);\n\n• Insufficient transport capacity (air assets, small trucks or off-road truck and river boats);\n\n• Possible congestion at entry point (Beira)",
