Situation Update** \n\n• According to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), flood waters continue to decrease, leading to increasing movement of people, including in and around Chimoio. However, it will still take some time for the rivers to recede below the medium alert level in most areas. Key areas being monitored for potential new flooding are Marromeu, Nhamatanda, Muanza, Mopeia and Maganja da Costa districts in Sofala and Zambezia Provinces.\n\n• The risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains a major concern, with reports of rising cases of malaria, in addition to cases of cholera and acute diarrhea. Beira and Dondo are both cholera endemic areas in Mozambique and the risk of spread is high.\n\n• The ramp in Beira airport was saturated on the evening of Thursday 29 March. The handling capacity at the airport is stretched. Partners are encouraged to share their upstream pipeline of cargo with the Logistics Cluster to coordinate and avoid bottlenecks. The Logistics Cluster recommends partners with no critical cargo to send it to Maputo and transport it by road to Beira.\n\n• To ensure a seamless provision of common services, the Logistics Cluster requires partners to submit their Service Request Forms at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.",
