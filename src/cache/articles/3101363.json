                "body": "A. SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\n**Description of the disaster**\n\n Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique through the city of Beira, central Mozambique on 14th March 2019 at 23:30 GMT. Winds from the cyclone reached more than 100 miles per hour, and caused heavy rains affecting Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces. Mozambique National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) indicated that 1.5 million people were affected, including more than 140,000 people displaced – many sheltered across 139 evacuation centres, spontaneous settings and makeshift shelters. At the moment, some 603 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the cyclone, according to the most recent reports issued by INGC. At the same time, more than 1,500 people were injured, and more than 230,000 houses were damaged and destroyed. \n\nTropical Cyclone Idai has also affected Mozambique’s food security and livelihoods in the long term, due to extensive damage to standing crops immediately before the harvest season due in the months of March-April as well as loss of seeds and tools1. The entire southern Africa region has been facing the effects of the ongoing El Niño with below-average cumulative rainfall and abnormally high temperatures for the 2018/19 season. The whole southern Africa region has suffered from sustained drought in recent years.\n\nFEWS NET also describes the impact of Tropical Cyclone Desmond, which brought localized floods and strong winds in areas around Beira and Dondo cities of Sofala Province through January 2019. Flooding from Desmond and other localized flooding resulted in the deaths of 1,285 cattle and other small animals and affected 60,167 hectares of crops.  \nThe impacts from the landfall of Tropical Cyclone Idai has destroyed over 715,000 hectares of crops in central Mozambique. \n\nWinds and floods also affected water and sanitation infrastructures across the provinces, especially in Beira. Stagnant water, lack of hygiene and sanitation condition provides a perfect breeding ground for cholera and malaria, which are both endemic diseases in the country. Reports from Handicap International published in late March indicate that 45 health centres have been destroyed, with 28 out 157 health facilities in Sofala province alone which are either entirely or partially destroyed. This further complicates the situation of people injured and especially vulnerable groups. One key example is pregnant women, of whom there are more than 75,000. From this figure, close to 43,000 are expected to give birth during the next six months, risking complications due to lack access to health facilities and care. Endemic diseases such as cholera and malaria pose an additional threat that grows at alarming rate. As of 12 April, official figures report at least 5,000 cholera cases in the country, and at least six deaths. Poor access to health facilities continues to be cut-off and hampering restocking of essential drugs and medical supplies in the health centres, as evidenced in the [Buzi rapid assessment](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/MOZ_Rapid_Assessment_Report_FINAL_5Apr.pdf).",
