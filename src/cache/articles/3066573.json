                "status": "published",
                "body": "**Highlights:**\n\n- UNFPA has successfully positioned more than US$600,000, including pre-existing CERFapproved funds for food insecurity in the region.\n\n- Nearly 3 million people have been affected by flooding, among them more than 600,000 women of reproductive age, 70,000 pregnant women and 75,000 women who are HIV positive.\n\n- More than 2,500 cases of acute diarrhea and 5 cases of cholera have been confirmed.\n\n- More than 7,500 dignity kits and 50 tents have been positioned and distributed in Beira, Tete, Manicaand Zambezia in Mozambique.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nSince January, **the Southern Africa region** has been severely affected by flooding, due to the rainy season starting in Malawi and Tropical Cyclone Idai making landfall on 14 March, bringing torrential rainfall and strong winds to several provinces of Mozambique and with devastating effects for Beira city, as well as large sections of Malawi and Zimbabwe. Since 2018, Mozambique has been affected by acute food insecurity due to below average and erratic rainfall.  \nTo date, as many as 2,969,000 people have been affected and 193,000 sheltered in transit camps following the devastation in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, with others seeking refuge in neighbouring areas.  \n\nIn **Malawi**, an estimated 869,000 people have been affected by the floods, among them more than 217,000 women of childbearing age, of whom about 7152 are expecting deliveries in the next three months. In total almost 876,000 people have been displaced, 672 people were injured and 59 people have died.  \n\nMore than 170 camps have been set up to provide shelter for the affected people. At least two health facilities (Makhanga and Ndamera) in Nsanje District have been adversely affected, making case referrals difficult.  \n\nIn **Mozambique**, 1,850,000 people have been affected, among them an estimated 438,000 women of reproductive age, 67,000 pregnant women and 77,000 women who are HIV positive. Within the next 3 months, about 19,000 live births are expected and 3,000 women are expected to experience complications during pregnancy or childbirth.  \n\nThe death toll has risen to 468 people, with 1,528 injured. At least 130,000 people are sheltering in 161 sites across Sofala (199), Manica (27), Tete (4) and Zambezia (11).  \nMore than 2,500 cases of acute water diarrhoea (AWD) and five cases of cholera have been confirmed. The arrival of cholera vaccines for 450,000 people (2 doses each) was anticipated.  \nThe number of accommodation centres has risen to 29,housing 15,444 people; these were established by the government in schools and empty structures.  \n\nIn **Zimbabwe**, 250,000 people have been affected by the cyclone, of which 16,000 have been displaced. There are confirmed reports of more than 100 fatalities with 180 people missing, 110 injured, 45 marooned and 19 critically ill. Four hospitals, hundreds of houses and bridges, schools and roads were washed away by flash floods and mudslides, especially in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts of Manicaland province.",
