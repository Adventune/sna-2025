                "body": "**Background** \n\nIn early March, a severe weather system formed off the eastern coast of Mozambique and Malawi, bringing heavy rains and strong winds, before tracking back to the Mozambique channel. Here, it intensified into Category 3 Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, once again bringing heavy rains and flooding to Malawi’s southern districts and causing significant infrastructure damage to roads and bridges. 868,900 people are reported to be affected across 15 districts. The worst affected areas are Chikwawa, Machinga, Nsanje, Phalombe and Zomba.  \n\nOn 8 March, the Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster and requested international assistance. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), the country’s national disaster management agency, is leading the response. In support of operations and to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas, WFP - as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster globally - and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MOTPW) - who are lead ministry for Transport, Logistics and Communications Sector - will provide coordination and information management support, as well as facilitating access to common logistics services. \n\n**Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks** \n\nIn partnership with the Government of Malawi, the Logistics Sector and partners have identified the following logistics constraints and limitations in delivering life-saving assistance to populations, as well as needs for improvement.  \n\nPersistent heavy rains and severe flooding have damaged logistics infrastructure including roads and bridges across affected areas in southern Malawi, making it challenging for the government and humanitarian community to deliver an effective and efficient logistics response. Some Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps across Phalombe, Nsanje and Chikwawa remain inaccessible and are only reachable by air or boat. While water levels are lowering, rehabilitation works on roads and bridges are ongoing and road conditions remain challenging with many only accessible with 4x4 light vehicles and 4x4 trucks (5 mt capacity). Given the isolated nature of several IDP camps, it is expected that Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) will be required as satellite hubs to ensure the relief items can be rapidly forwarded to affected areas. With an influx of relief items into Blantrye in support of the response, it is also anticipated that additional warehousing will be required to supplement local capacity.  \n\nCoordination and information sharing are key gaps in the humanitarian response that along with duplication of effort, are impacting operational decision making and effectiveness. A strong information management and coordination system is crucial to ensure logistics constraints and bottlenecks are clearly identified and partners work together towards a common response. Moreover, reinforcement of technical logistics expertise will also assist in supporting the response effort.  \n\nBased on the above analysis, the major logistics constraints are:\n\n• Limited road access to some of the affected areas in Southern Malawi \n\n• Limited transport capacity, particularly 4x4 trucks, boats and air assets \n\n• Insufficient storage and transport capacity, particularly in remote areas \n\n• Lack of consolidated logistics information and coordination efforts Additional needs may be identified during the on-going and planned assessments of the humanitarian supply-chain operations.",
