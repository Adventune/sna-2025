                "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- The 2018/2019 season was the driest since at least 1981 in central and western parts of the region.  \nThe drought resulted in crop failure, reduced forage, and poor water availability.\n\n- A delayed and erratic onset of rains, mid-season dry spells, and early cessation of rains in several parts of the region have contributed to poor crop production expectations in many areas.\n\n- Tropical Cyclone Idai brought strong winds and heavy rains to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, resulting in fatalities and severe damage, most significantly in Mozambique.\n\n- Rainfall performance in a few north-eastern areas has resulted in good harvest prospects there.\n\n- National crop production assessments are currently underway, and will help to quantify the impacts of the 2018/2019 seasonal performance on food availability. \n\n**Summary**\n\nA strong drought affected central and western parts of the region during the 2018/2019 rainfall season. Many parts of southern Angola, northern and southern Botswana, northern Namibia, north-western South Africa, southern and western Zambia, and north-western Zimbabwe, received their lowest seasonal (October-to-March) rainfall totals since at least 1981 (Figure 1, brown colours). The low seasonal rainfall totals observed in the region were primarily the result of (a) delayed and erratic onset of rains in several areas that resulted in reduced area planted and poor germination, (b) mid-season dry spells of varying duration that resulted in moisture stress and wilting of crops, and (c) an early cessation of rains across central areas that further exacerbated pre-mature wilting of crops. Additionally, in mid-March, Cyclone Idai destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cropland in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Cumulatively, these factors reduced end of season production prospects due to reductions in planted area, reduced yields, and outright crop failure in some areas. At a local scale, the poor seasonal performance will have the most severe impacts in cropping areas where widespread crop failure occurred, as well as areas with preexisting high levels of food insecurity due to poor 2017-2018 seasonal production. At a regional level, some of the most affected areas are high maize producing areas, which will negatively impact regional maize supplies. In many countries, survey teams are currently in the field generating crop production estimates that will better quantify the availability of food crops at sub-national and national level.\n\nThe drought also affected water supplies for domestic, industrial and agricultural (irrigation and livestock) usage. Forage for livestock was also negatively impacted, and reductions in pasture availability will be experienced in the worst affected areas as the dry season progresses. The poor grazing and water conditions are negatively affecting livestock. Over 30,000 drought-related cattle deaths were recorded in Namibia between October 2018 and April 2019.\n\nA few north-eastern parts of the region received good rainfall for much of the season, including central and northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, parts of Tanzania, and north-eastern Zambia. Good harvests are expected in some of these areas.",

Many parts of southern Angola, northern and southern Botswana, northern Namibia, north-western South Africa, southern and western Zambia, and north-western Zimbabwe, received their lowest seasonal (October-to-March) rainfall totals since at least 1981 (Figure 1, brown colours). The low seasonal rainfall totals observed in the region were primarily the result of (a) delayed and erratic onset of rains in several areas that resulted in reduced area planted and poor germination, (b) mid-season dry spells of varying duration that resulted in moisture stress and wilting of crops, and (c) an early cessation of rains across central areas that further exacerbated pre-mature wilting of crops. Additionally, in mid-March, Cyclone Idai destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cropland in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Cumulatively, these factors reduced end of season production prospects due to reductions in planted area, reduced yields, and outright crop failure in some areas. At a local scale, the poor seasonal performance will have the most severe impacts in cropping areas where widespread crop failure occurred, as well as areas with preexisting high levels of food insecurity due to poor 2017-2018 seasonal production. At a regional level, some of the most affected areas are high maize producing areas, which will negatively impact regional maize supplies. In many countries, survey teams are currently in the field generating crop production estimates that will better quantify the availability of food crops at sub-national and national level.</p>\n<p>The drought also affected water supplies for domestic, industrial and agricultural (irrigation and livestock) usage. Forage for livestock was also negatively impacted, and reductions in pasture availability will be experienced in the worst affected areas as the dry season progresses. The poor grazing and water conditions are negatively affecting livestock. Over 30,000 drought-related cattle deaths were recorded in Namibia between October 2018 and April 2019.</p>\n<p>A few north-eastern parts of the region received good rainfall for much of the season, including central and northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, parts of Tanzania, and north-eastern Zambia. Good harvests are expected in some of these areas.</p>\n",
