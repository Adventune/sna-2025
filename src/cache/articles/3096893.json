The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) received a rapid assessment report from the district council, indicating that extensive damage has been caused in most parts of Sub-TA Chapinduka, mainly in Tcharo area. A search and rescue team has been deployed and DoDMA has dispatched basic relief items.\n\n• On 24 April, a Humanitarian Country Team meeting (HCT) was held in Lilongwe. The meeting focused on the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report.\n\n• According to the report the floods caused US $36.1 million in damage to the transport infrastructure. In total, 1,841 km of paved and unpaved road networks were completely damaged, as well as 68 culverts and drifts. Additionally, 103 bridges are reported to have completely washed away. No damage has been reported for railway lines or ports.\n\n• During the meeting, the Logistics Sector reiterated that a noted challenge remains lack of information sharing regarding partners’ pipeline. Attending agencies were reminded to complete the Malawi flood response pipeline template, available online here, in an effort to strengthen operational planning.\n\n• The schedule for upcoming Cluster Coordination meetings has been published here by OCHA.",
