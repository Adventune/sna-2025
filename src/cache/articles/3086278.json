Over 270, 000 people have been affected.\n\nDestruction to infrastructure and property is severe.

UNHCR has also brought 60 tarpaulins and 300 tents from Zambia specifically for refugees who need immediate shelter. A limited distribution of these has begun.\n\nOn 9 April, UNHCR airlifted additional CRIs for 5,300 affected refugees in Tongogara refugee camp.\n\nThe airlifts contained blankets, kitchen sets, jerry cans, mosquito nets, solar lamps, sanitary pads and soap\n\n**CHOLERA PREVENTION**\n\nCholera has reached the border between Mozambique and Zimbabwe. UNHCR Zimbabwe has ensured that refugees are covered in the current vaccination campaign in the region affected by the cyclone and is prioritising the installation of proper latrines for refugees to avoid the spread of disease. So far, no confirmed cases of cholera has been reported.",
