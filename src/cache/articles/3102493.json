It requires a total of US$1.2 million to provide critical communications services in up to four operational areas for six months along with a number of connection sites including accommodation centres, health centres, distribution points and humanitarian hubs. \n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nTropical Cyclone Kenneth slammed into Mozambique’s Northern Coast on 25 April, just five weeks after the country was struck by powerful Cyclone Idai, from which the country is only just beginning to recover. Cyclone Kenneth is the first tropical cyclone with the equivalent of hurricane strength to strike Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado since modern record-keeping began 60 years ago. According to the UN, the strike by Kenneth marked the first time in recorded history that Mozambique has been hit by two powerful cyclones in the same season.\n\nAs of 28 April, heavy rains continue in Cabo Delgado province and are expected to continue for the next 2-3 days. An assessment done in the northern city of Pemba confirmed that the communications status is very bad and urgently needed.",
