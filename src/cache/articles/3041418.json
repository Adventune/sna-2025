Close to 94,000 people are displaced and sheltering in IDP sites.\n\n• An inter-agency assessment team, including national and international partners, deployed to Nsanje and Phalombe to conduct verifications of areas reporting internally displaced persons.  \nVerifications will be conducted for other districts with high numbers of affected people (Zomba,  \nMachinga and Mangochi) beginning 18 March.\n\n• In Nsanje and Phalombe, close to 183,000 people were affected with 26,000 displaced in 32 IDP sites throughout the two districts.\n\n• The Humanitarian Country Team met on 15 March to maximize coordination with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) and the various humanitarian partners.  \nIt was considered essential that an early recovery approach be mainstreamed through the clusters at the initial stages of the response. This would ensure that resilience building programming and emergency response are implemented concurrently.",
