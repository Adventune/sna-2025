Humanitarian organizations have prepositioned supplies and have additional teams on stand-by to deploy to the area.\n\n**Situation Update**\n\nOn the evening of 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall between the districts of Macomia and Mocimboa da Praia. Although preliminary information on impact is still incoming, the stormâ€™s cyclonic winds were expected to reach 180 kilometres per hour prior to landfall, according to the Mozambique National Institute for Meteorology (INM). The Cyclone is forecasted to bring heavy rains, with over 500mm of rainfall expected from 24 to 30 April, and more than 750mm possible in some locations in Cabo Delgado.\n\nAs the storm comes at the end of the rainy season, river levels are already high, and several rivers are projected to increase beyond the severe alert threshold after landfall, with peak flows most likely to occur on 29 April in the region around Pemba (Mozambique). There is a high risk of flash flooding and landslides.\n\nThis is the first time in recorded history that two strong tropical cyclones have hit Mozambique in the same season, with Tropical Cyclone Kenneth following on the heels of Tropical Cyclone Idai, which made landfall on 14 March, leaving more than 600 people dead and an estimated 1.85 million people in need in Mozambique alone.\n\nSouthern Tanzania and eastern Malawi are also expected to receive rains caused by the weather system.",
