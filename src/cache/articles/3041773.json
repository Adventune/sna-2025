Situation Update**\n\n• Following Tropical Cyclone Idai, heavy rains are expected to continue in affected areas across central Mozambique until 21 March.\n\n• According to the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), affected areas are at risk of further flooding, with dams reaching 95-100% capacity.\n\n• As per the Government of Mozambique, the extent of the damage is not yet known due to lack of access to affected areas.\n\n• The Logistics Cluster has not yet been activated. The assessment team from the Global Logistics Cluster took part in a World Food Programme (WFP) mission in Chimoio on 18 March to assess the airport status and potential availability of storage capacity to support the overall humanitarian response, if required.\n\n• The team will arrive to Beira, the hardest-hit area by the cyclone, on 19 March to map needs for common logistics services, coordination and Information Management. Preliminary information indicates there are storage and transport gaps in Beira that need to be taken into consideration.\n\n• An additional resource from the Global Logistics Cluster unit will be deployed to Maputo (arriving March 20) to support with coordination activities.",
