                "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- There has been a significant reduction in the number of displaced people - with 73,296 people currently hosted in 70 accommodation centres; down from 142,327 people the week before.\n\n- A total of 4,979 cholera cases were recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and the death toll has reached eight.\n\n- With UNICEF support, 814,293 people were vaccinated against cholera representing 99 per cent of the target population.\n\n- UNICEF continues supporting FIPAG (the water supply institution),  \nGovernment and operators to run water supply systems in affected areas providing drinking water to 771,856 people.\n\n- UNICEF provided education supplies to the Provincial Education Department in Sofala province for 14,000 students;\n\n- UNICEF-supported Child- Friendly Spaces in Sofala and Manica with 4,837 children receiving psychosocial services.\n\n- During the reporting period, UNICEF supported 900 social mobilizers who reached 30,000 families in the most critical areas of Beira promoting preventive WASH-related behaviours to stop the spread of the cholera infection, bringing the total of people reached to 449,000.\n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs** \n\nAs of 11 April 2019, there were a total of 4,979 cholera cases recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and the death toll had reached eight. Most of the cases have been reported in Beira (3,621 cases), followed by Dondo (697), Nhamatanda (544 cases) and Buzi (117). Half of the deaths were recorded in Beira and the remaining in Dondo and Nhamatanda districts. The cholera vaccination campaign carried out in Sofala province (four districts affected by the cyclone and floods) from 3– 10 April was successfully implemented and about 814,293 people were vaccinated; representing 99 per cent of the target population. Most of the vaccination occurred in Beira city, where about 422,958 people (98.5 per cent of the target) were vaccinated.  \n\nFrom 27 March to 9 April a cumulative 7,534 cases of malaria were detected in Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi districts. In Buzi the notification system for malaria resumed on 5 April due to communication constraints.  \n\nDuring the reporting week, the number of displaced persons hosted in accommodation/transit centres has reduced significantly. As of 12 April, 73,296 people remained displaced due to the cyclone and flooding. The displaced people are largely hosted in 70 transit centres in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces. The largest number of transit centres are in Sofala, where at least 40,767 people are hosted in 30 centres. From 8 - 12 April the Government reported that about 94 centres were closed, most of them in Sofala province. However, ten schools are still serving as transit centres. According to Government officials, some of the population had returned to their areas of origin, while others were re-located to the new sites. On 11 April, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) presented a plan to relocate 15,549 families in four districts of Sofala. In Manica, the Government has also started the relocation of 24,000 people currently in 26 accommodation centres in the Dombe region. The Government is delineating land plots for displaced people on a daily basis with about 2,681 plots in three provinces available to be transferred to the population.  \n\nOverall, INGC estimates that at least 1,514,662 people were affected by the cyclone and floods in the central region of the country.  \n\nAccording to the INGC, at least 335,132 students are affected by the floods and cyclone due to the damage of 3,504 classrooms in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces. At least 55 health facilities are affected in Sofala, Manica and Zambezia.",
