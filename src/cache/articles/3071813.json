The GRM reports that approximately 129,800 people were sheltering in 129 accommodation sites in Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambézia provinces as of April 5. In addition, the number of homes damaged or destroyed by the cyclone has increased to more than 216,700, according to the GRM.\n\n- The GRM Ministry of Health (MoH) had reported nearly 2,100 cholera cases, including two deaths, in Sofala’s Beira and Dondo towns and Buzi District as of April 5, according to the UN. In response, health agencies are conducting a cholera vaccination campaign, reaching 32,000 people on the first day.\n\n- On April 2, the first of five planned airlifts of USAID food and nutrition commodities, including fortified cereals and fortified vegetable oil, arrived in Beira from USAID‘s warehouse in Djibouti. The commodities will provide food and nutrition assistance to an estimated 160,000 people impacted by the cyclone for one month.\n\n- The UN released a revised flash appeal for Zimbabwe on April 5, requesting an additional $60 million to address the humanitarian needs of approximately 270,000 people affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai. As of April 5, international donors had contributed nearly $5.4 million to the cyclone-related appeal, according to the UN.\n\n- On April 3, two USAID staff arrived in Malawi to conduct assessments of cyclone-related damages and humanitarian needs. Relief organizations highlighted agriculture, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs and noted that displaced populations were sheltering in camps, churches, and schools with limited sanitation facilities.",
