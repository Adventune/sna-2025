The electricity company (EDM) expects to re-establish completely the system within 30 – 60 days depending on the level of damage in affected districts. The significant progress made by EDM this week was the reestablishment of electricity at the waste water treatment system in Beira and at the intake of the water supply system in Dondo.  \n\nAs of 18 April 2019, there were a total of 6,385 cholera cases recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and a death toll of 8. Most of the cases have been reported in Beira (4,524), followed by Dondo (1,013), Nhamatanda (726) and Buzi (122). From 27 March to 18 April a cumulative number of 12,917 Malaria cases were recorded in Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi districts. Most of the of the cases (41.2% - 5,319) were registered in Nhamatanda district. Although the total cumulative cases of Cholera are higher than the one reported last week, the overall trend of the daily cases is reducing (e.g: from 17 April to 18 April there was a reduction from 127 to 63 cases) in all affected districts. One week after the completion of cholera vaccination campaign in Sofala province, the health authorities are expanding the vaccination to other risk areas within the province, namely, Munza, Cheringoma, Nhamatanda and Buzi districts. As of 17 April 2019, 27,026 people out of 57,906 were vaccinated in those districts representing 46.7 per centof the target.  \n\nAs of 20 April 2019, there were 26 accommodation centres hosting 45,362 people in the districts of Dondo, Buzi, Nhamatanda, Chibabava and Beira of Sofala province. According to INGC, as of 20 April 2019, there are in total 66 transit/accommodation centers with 77,003 people in the provinces of Zambézia (3), Manica (32), Sofala (26) and Tete (5).  \n\nThe Government continues with the delineation of land plots to be assigned to the displaced population currently hosted in accommodation centers. To date, a total of 2,394 plots were delineated in Sofala, of which 1,129 were already assigned to the displaced population in Nhamatanda, Buzi and Caia districts. According to the Provincial Authorities, in Sofala province, there is a need to resettle about 10,974 families and 650 families were already resettled in Caia and Nhamatanda districts.  \n\nThis week, in Sofala province (Beira and Buzi) at least four transit/accommodation centers were closed and about 3,137 people were transferred to new sites. On 20 April 2019, the Government started the transfer of 92 families from Buzi and hosted in IFAPA accommodation center to their area of origin (Buzi district). As an effort of putting in place minimum conditions for the returnees in Guara-Guara accommodation center (Buzi district), UNICEF supported the water company (FIPAG) to provide safe drinking water (water tanks and pump) to about 900 families (4,500 people). In addition, UNICEF also provided 200 slabs and tarpaulins to build latrines in accommodation centers.  \n\nThe Government, jointly with the UN System, the European Union and the World Bank, have launched a post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) to evaluate impact, damages and losses across key sectors and to inform a national post disaster recovery strategy. UNICEF is co-leading in the education, WASH and social protection sectoral components of the PDNA, working with the Government and partners to quantify damages and loses, as well as required inputs for early recovery and reconstruction. The process in expected to be completed in May 2019, with the PDNA assessment highlighting financial requirements for the national recovery framework.",
