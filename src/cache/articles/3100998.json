A total of 868,895 people were affected, including more than 86,976 displaced persons, with 60 deaths and 672 injuries recorded according to the Government. In total, 15 districts and two cities have been impacted.  \n\nThere have been no further floods since mid-March. Waters have receded, and displaced persons have started to return home. However, due to flood-related damage to people’s houses, around 70 per cent remain in camps. More than 731,000 people need immediate food assistance and the situation is likely to worsen, as crops were destroyed by the floods.  \n\nConditions in evacuation centers are improving but camps remain cramped and unhygienic. Food and other supplies are not reaching all people affected. There have been three cases of cholera reported since the floods. Several schools continued being used as evacuation camps, negatively impacting on children’s education.",
