At least 146 people were killed from flooding caused by the storm, including 66 in Mozambique, 56 in Malawi, and 24 in Zimbabwe. Various homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, and police stations were damaged, and thousands were forced to leave for higher ground. The cyclone reportedly impacted over 1.5 million people across the countries. There were also reports of power cuts. Flights throughout the region were disrupted during the storm. Ongoing flood-related impacts are being covered in separate Severe Flooding incidents for Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. The government has confirmed 66 dead and the President has indicated the count could rise to 1,000.  \n\n**Significant Updates** \n\nBelow is a summary of current conditions and significant updates. In many of the villages the houses are made of locally-sourced materials and the population lives on subsistence agriculture. Heavy rains earlier in the week, before the cyclone struck, had already claimed another 66 lives, injured scores and displaced 17,000 people \n\n19 Mar \n\n- Victims are reportedly trapped on roofs and clinging to trees awaiting rescue, UN agencies said, while across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, tens of thousands of people have lost their homes, while roads, bridges and crops have been washed away. UNOCHA \n\n- UN Children’s Fund @UNICEF reported that 260,000 children have been affected UNOCHA \n\n18 Mar \n\n- Beira 90% damaged - situation outside the city could be even worse.
