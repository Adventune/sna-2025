Food drops were carried out to provide immediate assistance and follow-up is ongoing.\n\n- Nearly 136,000 people were accommodated in 161 sites across Sofala (119 sites), Manica (27 sites), Zambezia (11 sites) and Tete (4 sites) as of 27 March; an increase of more than 9,200 people from 26 March.\n\n- More than 92,000 houses were identified as totally destroyed (50,772), partially destroyed (25,769) or flooded (15,784) as of 27 March; an increase of more than 1,300 since 26 March.\n\n- Health partners have raised concern over menstrual hygiene as most girls and women in IDP accommodation sites reportedly do not have access to clean water and safe spaces to hang sanitary materials. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nOn 27 March, the Government confirmed five cases of cholera at Munhava health centre in Beira City, according to the National Director of Medical Assistance, Ussene Isse. The authorities also reported some 2,500 cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) in Beira district. A total of 900,000 cholera vaccine doses, which will be effective for six months, are expected to arrive in Mozambique by 1 April and micro-planning for the vaccination campaign is underway.  \n\nThe number of internally displaced people (IDPs) accommodated in 161 sites across Sofala (119 sites), Manica (27 sites), Zambezia (11 sites) and Tete (4 sites) has risen by more than 9,200 people, to nearly 136,000 people, as of 27 March. More than 92,000 houses were identified as totally destroyed (50,772), partially destroyed (25,769) or flooded (15,784) as of 27 March; an increase of more than 1,300 since 26 March. More than 3,200 schools were destroyed and nearly 91,000 students are affected, including those whose schools are being used as accommodation sites. The Ministry of Education is preparing a timeline to address the forced break in schooling as the authorities work on transferring IDPs from schools into new accommodation sites to allow schools to reopen.  \n\nAn assessment team identified nearly 1,500 people in Pambanisa, Matarara, in Chimoio district, in urgent need of assistance. A food drop to last three days was carried out to assist them immediately and response is ongoing. An airdrop of shelter kits by helicopter is scheduled.\n \nIn Dombe, health centres are reportedly out of medical supplies and essential medicines and most are running without electricity. A private company has set-up a generator for the hospital in Sussungenga district, which is now fully operational.  \n\nWater supply has reportedly been reestablished in Beira, with 60 per cent of the pipes in the city having running water, according to WASH partners. A special water trucking operation is being run by the Government pending the repair of all damaged infrastructure. UK aid flights reportedly transported materials for the repair of the water systems in Beira, while WASH partners have provided technical support, fuel and water treatment chemicals for the systems.  \n\nFuel supply remains scarce in Manica Province. Although reports indicate that gasoline is now coming into the region but only a few people have access to it due to the increased prices and long queues, affecting transport business and movement. The Government has reportedly warned that traders caught speculating will be liable for “seizure of goods and a fine” according to media reports.  \n\nAccess remains a challenge to effective response. The Logistics Cluster has reported that the road from EN1 to Grudja (E3) has been blocked due to 20 metres of water and a mud pool, while the road to Buzi is inaccessible in some areas.",
