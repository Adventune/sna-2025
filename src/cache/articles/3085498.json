The Situation Report builds on Flash Updates #1 through #15 and provides detailed information on the situation and response by sector. The next report will be issued as of 15 April 2019.*\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n• One month since Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique, flood waters have begun to recede, but the needs remain.\n\n• Affected children are showing signs of severe psychological stress, including bedwetting, nightmares and anxiety, according to Save the Children.\n\n• More than 112,500 insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) have been distributed, targeting Dondo and Nhamatanda, which have a high number of reported malaria cases.\n\n• A total of 10,542 children under age 5 have been screened for acute malnutrition; out of these, 86 were diagnosed as severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 229 as moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).\n\n1.85M People in need\n\n5,656 Cholera cases\n\n603 Deaths\n\n~70K Displaced people in 69 collective sites\n\n~1.1M People assisted with food\n\n907K People reached with water support \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nIt has been one month since Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique, bringing death and destruction to large swathes of the central region of the country and leaving an estimated 1.85 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, including around one million children, and an estimated 74,650 pregnant women. One-month on, more than 1 million people have been reached with emergency assistance. However, although flood waters have receded in many areas, humanitarian needs remain high and there is an urgent need for additional funding to support the continued scale-up of the response and prevent further loss of life.  \n\nAs of 14 April, the official death toll remained at 603 people and the number of houses destroyed or damaged remained at 239,731, according to government figures. There was, however, a slight decrease in the number of displaced people in collective sites from 73,296 on 13 April to 70,610 on 14 April. Regarding the cholera situation, as of 14 April, 369 new cases were reported, bringing the total number of cholera cases to 5,656. Malaria cumulative cases also rose to 10,503.",

One-month on, more than 1 million people have been reached with emergency assistance. However, although flood waters have receded in many areas, humanitarian needs remain high and there is an urgent need for additional funding to support the continued scale-up of the response and prevent further loss of life.</p>\n<p>As of 14 April, the official death toll remained at 603 people and the number of houses destroyed or damaged remained at 239,731, according to government figures. There was, however, a slight decrease in the number of displaced people in collective sites from 73,296 on 13 April to 70,610 on 14 April. Regarding the cholera situation, as of 14 April, 369 new cases were reported, bringing the total number of cholera cases to 5,656. Malaria cumulative cases also rose to 10,503.</p>\n",
