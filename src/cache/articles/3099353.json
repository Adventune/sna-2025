In addition, nearly 73,000 people were sheltering in an estimated 65 accommodation centers across the country’s Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambézia provinces due to the cyclone as of April 22, the GRM reports. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) noted that the increase in the number of displaced people during the past week was likely due to individuals in Sofala relocating from unofficial collective sites to GRM-recognized accommodation centers.\n\n- Humanitarian agencies continue to monitor and respond to health challenges—including the spread of vector-borne and waterborne diseases—in cyclone-affected areas in Mozambique. Health actors had reported more than 6,600 cholera cases and eight cholera-related deaths, in Mozambique as of April 22, and approximately 14,900 malaria cases in Sofala’s Beira city, and Buzi, Dondo, and Nhamatanda districts as of April 23. In response, relief actors have distributed approximately 116,600 mosquito nets and are conducting disinfection activities in health centers and schools across affected areas.\n\n- Local authorities in Zimbabwe estimate that the cyclone displaced approximately 60,000 people in the four worst-affected districts. Relief actors have provided emergency food assistance to approximately 200,000 people in affected areas since the beginning of the emergency. Relief actors are also prioritizing the distribution of blankets and shelter supplies to address needs related to the recent cold and wet weather in cyclone-affected areas.\n\n- On April 18, the Government of Malawi (GoM) and other stakeholders held a meeting to discuss a timeline for internally displaced person returns. The GoM had established approximately 60 internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Chikwawa and Nsanje districts as of mid-April for the estimated 87,000 individuals displaced by the flooding.",

In addition, nearly 73,000 people were sheltering in an estimated 65 accommodation centers across the country’s Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambézia provinces due to the cyclone as of April 22, the GRM reports. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) noted that the increase in the number of displaced people during the past week was likely due to individuals in Sofala relocating from unofficial collective sites to GRM-recognized accommodation centers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Humanitarian agencies continue to monitor and respond to health challenges—including the spread of vector-borne and waterborne diseases—in cyclone-affected areas in Mozambique. Health actors had reported more than 6,600 cholera cases and eight cholera-related deaths, in Mozambique as of April 22, and approximately 14,900 malaria cases in Sofala’s Beira city, and Buzi, Dondo, and Nhamatanda districts as of April 23. In response, relief actors have distributed approximately 116,600 mosquito nets and are conducting disinfection activities in health centers and schools across affected areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Local authorities in Zimbabwe estimate that the cyclone displaced approximately 60,000 people in the four worst-affected districts. Relief actors have provided emergency food assistance to approximately 200,000 people in affected areas since the beginning of the emergency. Relief actors are also prioritizing the distribution of blankets and shelter supplies to address needs related to the recent cold and wet weather in cyclone-affected areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On April 18, the Government of Malawi (GoM) and other stakeholders held a meeting to discuss a timeline for internally displaced person returns. The GoM had established approximately 60 internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Chikwawa and Nsanje districts as of mid-April for the estimated 87,000 individuals displaced by the flooding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
