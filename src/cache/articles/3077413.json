IOM is coordinating closely with cluster partners to ensure active delivery of essential services including protection,  \nWASH, and health. \n\nIOM has been requested to oversee the set up of protection help desks and a referral mechanism at relocation sites by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Welfare, GBV sub-cluster and CCCM Task Force partners.  \nThe effort will begin at the 5 IOM established sites before being replicated. \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in central Mozambique on 14 March 2019. An estimated 1.85 million people across Mozambique have been affected, according to the UN. As of 06 April, 602 people are confirmed dead and 1,641 injured according to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC). 239,682 houses were identified by authorities as totally destroyed (111,163), partially destroyed (112,735) or flooded (15,784). This number is anticipated to rapidly expand as flood waters recede.  \n\nMore than 160,927 displaced people are sheltering in 164 sites across Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete. A World Bank commissioned rapid remote assessment to estimate the financial impacts of Cyclone Idai suggests as much as USD 773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture.  \n\nOn 07 April, the Ministry of Health confirmed 2,454 cases of cholera including 6 deaths. Most of the cases reported have been in Beira, followed by Nhamatanda and Dondo. A weeklong cholera vaccination campaign commenced on 03 April with and over 400,000 people have been vaccinated to date. 11 Cholera Treatment Centres have been established by health cluster partners and government in response. IOM’s emergency health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programming experts are being deployed from across the region to Mozambique in order to support these urgent concerns. \n \nIOM’s main office in Maputo is coordinating response activities with sub-offices in Tete and Beira to support the emergency response. In addition, IOM is deploying over 30 international technical experts on Shelter, Camp Management, Health, Protection, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and Early Recovery to enhance response capacity and initiate new activities.  \n\nIOM is co-leading the Shelter-NFI cluster with IFRC and leading on Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) related issues alongside Government counterparts.  \nIn order to respond to the humanitarian needs of 1.85 million people affected by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, IOM is appealing for USD 36.4 million for its emergency response for the next six months to September 2019. The UN is urgently seeking an additional USD 282 million of relief aid over the next three months to 30 June 2019. As of 08 April, the Humanitarian Response Plan is funded at USD 68.1M, 20.2% of funding requirements of USD 337M.",
