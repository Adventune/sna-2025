In addition, the number of homes damaged or destroyed by the cyclone has increased to more than 239,700, the GRM reports.\n\n- The GRM Ministry of Health (MoH) had reported nearly 3,600 cholera cases, including six cholera-related deaths, in Sofala’s Beira and Dondo towns and Buzi and Nhamatanda districts as of April 8. In response, health agencies are conducting a cholera vaccination campaign, reaching more than 747,600 people as of April 8.\n\n- USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members conducted additional assessments in Sofala’s Beira, Buzi, and Dondo towns to identify health and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs, as well as gaps in assistance. The DART is working with health and WASH organizations to strengthen disease surveillance systems and response capacity.\n\n- On April 4, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched an appeal requesting $7.2 million to provide humanitarian assistance to more than 90,000 individuals affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe. The UN agency identified camp coordination and camp management, early recovery, health, protection, and shelter as priority needs in the country.\n\n- From April 6–8, USAID staff conducted assessments in Malawi of needs generated by cyclone-related flooding and met with key humanitarian agencies, including USAID partner CARE. Following the assessments, USAID staff plan to prioritize agriculture, protection, shelter, and WASH assistance for flooding-affected households.",
