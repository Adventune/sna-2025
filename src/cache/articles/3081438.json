The government plan is to move the displaced population from Buzi and those living in lower lands to a relocation/integration site where the demarcation is presently taking place.\n\nAccording to the Director of the District, the school is hosting 779 families / 2,114 individuals, all of whom are from the Buzi village. The Director estimated that the 60% of the population is female, which is not un-similar to the demographic breakdown prior to the cyclone.
