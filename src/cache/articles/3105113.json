These services are not intended to replace the logistics capacities of other organisations, nor are they meant to compete with the commercial market. Rather, they are intended to fill identified gaps and provide a last resort option in case other service providers are not available.  \n\nTransport services are planned to be available until 31 May 2019, with the possibility of further extension. Storage services are planned to be available until 30 June 2019. The services may be withdrawn before this date in part or in full, for any of the following reasons:\n\n• Changes in the situation on the ground   \n• No longer an agreed upon/identified need   \n• Funding constraints  \n\nThis document will be updated, and services provided may change as the situation evolves and operational requirements develop. Updated versions will be shared on the Malawi Operations page (https://logcluster.org/sector/mwi19a) and shared via the mailing list.",
