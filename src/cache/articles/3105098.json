Here, it intensified into Category 3 Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, once again bringing heavy rains and flooding to Malawi’s southern districts and causing significant infrastructure damage to roads and bridges. 868,900 people are reported to be affected across 15 districts. The worst affected areas are Chikwawa, Machinga, Nsanje, Phalombe and Zomba.  \nOn 8 March, the Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster and requested international assistance. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), the country’s national disaster management agency, is leading the response. In support of operations and to assist the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas,  \nWFP - as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster globally - and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MOTPW) - who are lead ministry for Transport, Logistics and Communications Sector - will provide coordination and information management support, as well as facilitating access to common logistics services.",
