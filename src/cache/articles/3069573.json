                "body": "*This Situation Report is produced by OCHA Regional Office for Southern and Eastern Africa in collaboration with humanitarian partners. The Situation Report builds on Flash Updates #1 through #15 and provides more detailed information on the situation and response by sector. The next report will be issued on 4 April 2019.*\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n• More than 198,300 houses were reportedly destroyed as of 3 April; an increase of more than 86,000 houses since 2 April, according to the authorities.\n\n• At least 131,100 people were sheltering in 136 sites across Manica (21); Sofala (107); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3) provinces as of 3 April, according to government figures, including nearly 28,000 vulnerable people identified by authorities.\n\n• The Oral Cholera Vaccination Campaign started as planned on 3 April and 32,000 people were vaccinated on the first day.\n\n• At least 1,741 cases of cholera and two deaths were reported as of 3 April, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\n• Nearly 53,000 people have been provided basic shelter assistance - primarily plastic sheeting and blankets - as of 3 April.\n\n• More than half a million people have been reached with food assistance and nearly 89,000 people are targeted for seeds and tools distribution in the coming days.\n\n**1.85M** Affected people \n\n**1,741** Cholera cases \n\n**>198K** Houses destroyed/damaged \n\n**598** Deaths \n\n**>715K** Hectares of crops destroyed \n\n**>539K** People assisted with food\n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nThe official death toll as of 3 April stood at 598 and more than 1,600 people injured, according to the Government. At least 131,100 people were still sheltering in 136 sites across Manica (21); Sofala (107); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3) as of 3 April. The number of vulnerable people reported by the Government in the accommodation sites rose significantly by more than 20,000 people to 27,764 as of 3 April.\n\nThe number of houses destroyed rose by more than 86,000 from 2 April. More than 198,300 houses have been totally destroyed (85,265), partially destroyed (97,276) or flooded (15,784), with more than 715,000 hectares of crops reportedly destroyed, according to the Government. The destruction of crops near the main harvest time continues to raise concerns over food security prospects in the long-term.\n\nNearly 151,000 students of school going age have been affected, as more than 3,300 classrooms have been destroyed, damaged and/or occupied by displaced people. The number of accommodation sites in Zambezia reduced from 13 to 3 from 1 to 3 April, reflecting significant returns by people previously displaced, according to the authorities.\n\nAt least 1,741 cases of cholera and two deaths were reported as of 3 April, according to the Ministry of Health. The vast majority of cases reported have been reported in Beira (1,449 cases; 1 death), Dondo (134 cases; 1 death) and Nhamatanda (158 cases). The number of cases reported in Dondo doubled from 2 April (66 cases) to 3 April (134) cases. The Ministry of Health and partners are rapidly responding and implementing prevention and treatment.  \n\nAccess by road remains a challenge in several areas. Preliminary reports from a joint Government-inter-agency mission from Vilankulos to Sofala Province has reported that Chibabava is accessible by road, but the surrounding remote areas remain accessible by air only. There are five collective centres in Chibabava, only one of which (Xinhika) is reachable by road. The rest (Goonda Madjaca (403 households), Gerome (375 households), Xinhica Mudava (142 households), Xiquaxa (93 households) and Escola Secundaria File Jacnto Nyusse (9 households) are not reachable by road but have received some assistance by air from Beira.",

At least 131,100 people were still sheltering in 136 sites across Manica (21); Sofala (107); Tete (5) and Zambezia (3) as of 3 April. The number of vulnerable people reported by the Government in the accommodation sites rose significantly by more than 20,000 people to 27,764 as of 3 April.</p>\n<p>The number of houses destroyed rose by more than 86,000 from 2 April. More than 198,300 houses have been totally destroyed (85,265), partially destroyed (97,276) or flooded (15,784), with more than 715,000 hectares of crops reportedly destroyed, according to the Government. The destruction of crops near the main harvest time continues to raise concerns over food security prospects in the long-term.</p>\n<p>Nearly 151,000 students of school going age have been affected, as more than 3,300 classrooms have been destroyed, damaged and/or occupied by displaced people. The number of accommodation sites in Zambezia reduced from 13 to 3 from 1 to 3 April, reflecting significant returns by people previously displaced, according to the authorities.</p>\n<p>At least 1,741 cases of cholera and two deaths were reported as of 3 April, according to the Ministry of Health. The vast majority of cases reported have been reported in Beira (1,449 cases; 1 death), Dondo (134 cases; 1 death) and Nhamatanda (158 cases). The number of cases reported in Dondo doubled from 2 April (66 cases) to 3 April (134) cases. The Ministry of Health and partners are rapidly responding and implementing prevention and treatment.</p>\n<p>Access by road remains a challenge in several areas. Preliminary reports from a joint Government-inter-agency mission from Vilankulos to Sofala Province has reported that Chibabava is accessible by road, but the surrounding remote areas remain accessible by air only. There are five collective centres in Chibabava, only one of which (Xinhika) is reachable by road. The rest (Goonda Madjaca (403 households), Gerome (375 households), Xinhica Mudava (142 households), Xiquaxa (93 households) and Escola Secundaria File Jacnto Nyusse (9 households) are not reachable by road but have received some assistance by air from Beira.</p>\n",
