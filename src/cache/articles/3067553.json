                "body": "**Highlights** \n\n- A total of 868,900 people have been affected by the heavy rains and severe flooding in southern Malawi, including more than 86,980 people displaced, 60 deaths and 672 injuries recorded.\n\n- The Government of Malawi has launched a three-month response plan, and US$45 million appeal, targeting 162,240 households, including over 85,000 people in various displacement sites.\n\n- UNICEF is supporting multi-sectoral interventions in WASH, health, nutrition, education and child protection to meet the needs of the affected population.\n\n- UNICEF has provided 48 tents, 143 school in a box kits and 80 recreation kits to provide safe learning spaces for children, whose schools have been damaged or occupied by displaced people.\n\n- UNICEF is also supporting the screening of children for malnutrition at evacuation sites. So far, 5,346 children under-5 have been screened. Of these, 343 cases of severe or moderate acute malnutrition have been registered, with 281 referred for treatment.\n\n- To meet the urgent humanitarian needs, UNICEF is requesting US$8.26 million of which 68 per cent remains unfunded, to meet the needs of affected women and children affected by the flood. \n\n**SITUATION IN NUMBERS** \n\n**3.3 million** People in need in need of urgent humanitarian support \n\n**443,136** Children under the age of 18 affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**868,895** People affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**Over 85,000** People displaced \n\n**219,195 children** Targeted by UNICEF \n\n**UNICEF HAC Appeal US$ 15.3 million** of which flood response requirement is US$ 8.26 million* \n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs**    \n\nOver 3.3 million people are classified as in need of urgent humanitarian support due to consecutive poor harvests in Malawi. These needs were exacerbated in early in early March, when a severe weather system hit Malawi with heavy rain accompanied by strong windstorms. This moved to Mozambique, where it intensified into Cyclone Idai, and then hit Malawi a second time. The heavy and persistent rains caused severe flooding across districts in southern Malawi. A total of 868,900 people (an estimated 443,000 children) have been affected, including more than 86,980 displaced people, with 60 deaths and 672 injuries recorded according to the Government. In total, fifteen districts and two cities have been impacted. Approximately 174 schools are affected (flooded or occupied) in four districts (Chikwawa, Phalombe, Nsanje, and Zomba). Out of the 174 schools, 104 are occupied by internally displaced people (IDPs). This has resulted in overcrowded or nonoperational schools; affecting an estimated 77,174 students.    \n\nThe flood affected areas are the same geographical area and target population as those locations with high rates of food insecurity. Food insecurity and malnutrition will be more pronounced as families return home due to the majority of crops being wiped out from the flooding just before harvest season.    \n\nThe Government of Malawi has launched a three-month response plan, appealing for US$45 million, to reach 162,240 households, including over 85,000 displaced people in various sites. This requested assistance is for immediate lifesaving aid and to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and malaria.",
