However, the mission also looked at the broader basic needs and protection issues.\n\n**Mandruzi Resettlement Village**\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nAs of Tuesday, 30 April (morning) 122 households were already at the site, of which 40 families arrived the previous night. These families were compelled to sleep in the open. 76 plots have been allocated, yet not all have been cleared due to the lack of the clearing tools and workforce.  \n\nAs a result of the lack of sufficient tents most families are sharing their tents.  \n\nThe population at the site is mostly composed of single women (including widows and separated women) with young children. \n \nThe majority of the population does not speak Portuguese, Sena being their main language.  \n\nThe leader of the community has compiled a list of the 122 families who are presently at the site. The list consists of the names of heads of households and family size.",
