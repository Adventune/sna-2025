                "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- On 29 March, a patient tested positive for cholera at Mwanza district hospital. This brings the number of cases of cholera recorded in Malawi in 2019 to a total of nine of which three have been registered after the March floods.\n\n- UNICEF has provided safe water to 53,334 people and sanitation facilities to 51,691 people.\n\n- For the lean season response, the 27 food insecure districts will require support up to mid-April 2019, instead of the end of March as initially planned due. Continuous rains and flooding impeded the implementation of the programme in some areas, leading to delays.\n\n- A post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) is underway to determine recovery and reconstruction needs in areas affected by floods as well as build resilience of communities, systems and infrastructure\n\n- UNICEF has received US$6.3 million for the overall humanitarian response in 2019, however, funding a gap of US $9,83million (64 per cent) remains. For the floods response, out of the required US$8.23 million a funding gap of US $6.34 million (77 per cent) remains as of the reporting date. UNICEF continues to mobilize funding to be able to respond effectively to the needs of the affected population. \n\n**SITUATION IN NUMBERS** \n\n**3.3 million** People in need in need of urgent humanitarian support \n\n**497,548** Children under the age of 18 affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**975,584** People affected by the cyclone and floods \n\n**About 100,000** People displaced \n\n**219,195 children** Targeted by UNICEF \n\n**UNICEF HAC Appeal US$ 15.3 million** of which flood response requirement is US$ 8.3 million* \n\n**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs** \n\nThe 2018 Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) Annual Assessment, projected that 3.3 million people (661, 281 households) to be at risk of food insecurity in 27 out of 28 districts. MVAC recommended the provision of food assistance to start from October 2018 to March, 2019 across the 27 districts depending on severity of the food situation. The Government through Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), district councils and partners have been providing relief maize to the food insecure households. As at 03 April 2019, a total of 657,261 families had received maize. Food distribution has been completed in eight districts (Dedza, Karonga Kasungu Lilongwe, Mchinji, Ntcheu, Ntchisi Salima). In addition, complimentary top up cash transfers have been provided in some districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Chiradzulu, Machinga, Mwanza, Mchinji, Nkhotakota, Nsanje, Phalombe, Salima, and Zomba). Flooding has made some of the roads impassable, therefore, delaying the food distribution as well as prepositioning in some of the sites. The programme will continue with distribution of double rations in selected districts to expedite implementation and complete the exercise by mid-April.1 Food needs were exacerbated in early March, when a severe weather system hit Malawi with heavy rain accompanied by strong winds. This moved to Mozambique, where it intensified into Cyclone Idai. Most of the flood affected areas are within the same geographical area and target population as those locations with pre-existing food insecurity.  \n\nThe Government of Malawi declared a disaster on 8 March 2019 in the areas affected by the flooding and subsequently launched a three-month flood response plan, appealing for US$45 million, to reach 162,240 families, including over 85,000 displaced people in various sites. This is for immediate lifesaving aid and to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and malaria. By 30 March, the number of affected families had reached 216,796 (975,584 people) with 22,162 families (99,728 people) forced to leave their flood, damaged homes. The displaced have sought temporary shelter in 202 sites. The registered death toll is 59, while 727 people are reportedly injured. It is anticipated that food insecurity and malnutrition will be more pronounced as families return home due to the destruction of crops in the floods.  \n\nIn those areas affected by the floods, there is an elevated risk of disease outbreaks due to stagnant water conditions, overcrowding in IDP camps, inadequate access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health care.  \n\nOn 29 March, a patient tested positive for cholera at Mwanza district hospital. The patient, a Malawian, came from Mozambique. This brings the number of cases of cholera recorded in Malawi in 2019 to a total of nine of which three have been registered after the flooding event (one in flood affected Nsanje district and two in Mchinji district which is not among the flood affected districts).  \nThe Government is undertaking a PDNA in the areas impacted by the floods to determine recovery and reconstruction needs. The early-recovery cluster has been activated. With technical and financial support from a tripartite agreement between World bank, the UN and EU, the PDNA exercise started with an orientation session on 4 April and is expected to be completed by mid-April. All 15 districts and two cities affected by the floods will be included in the assessment with the level of detail being dependent on the degree of impact. The exercise will involve analysis of the effects (damage and losses), the impact (macroeconomic and human) and the estimation of recovery and reconstruction needs of the floods on key social, productive and infrastructure sectors.",

MVAC recommended the provision of food assistance to start from October 2018 to March, 2019 across the 27 districts depending on severity of the food situation. The Government through Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), district councils and partners have been providing relief maize to the food insecure households. As at 03 April 2019, a total of 657,261 families had received maize. Food distribution has been completed in eight districts (Dedza, Karonga Kasungu Lilongwe, Mchinji, Ntcheu, Ntchisi Salima). In addition, complimentary top up cash transfers have been provided in some districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Chiradzulu, Machinga, Mwanza, Mchinji, Nkhotakota, Nsanje, Phalombe, Salima, and Zomba). Flooding has made some of the roads impassable, therefore, delaying the food distribution as well as prepositioning in some of the sites. The programme will continue with distribution of double rations in selected districts to expedite implementation and complete the exercise by mid-April.1 Food needs were exacerbated in early March, when a severe weather system hit Malawi with heavy rain accompanied by strong winds. This moved to Mozambique, where it intensified into Cyclone Idai. Most of the flood affected areas are within the same geographical area and target population as those locations with pre-existing food insecurity.</p>\n<p>The Government of Malawi declared a disaster on 8 March 2019 in the areas affected by the flooding and subsequently launched a three-month flood response plan, appealing for US$45 million, to reach 162,240 families, including over 85,000 displaced people in various sites. This is for immediate lifesaving aid and to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and malaria. By 30 March, the number of affected families had reached 216,796 (975,584 people) with 22,162 families (99,728 people) forced to leave their flood, damaged homes. The displaced have sought temporary shelter in 202 sites. The registered death toll is 59, while 727 people are reportedly injured. It is anticipated that food insecurity and malnutrition will be more pronounced as families return home due to the destruction of crops in the floods.</p>\n<p>In those areas affected by the floods, there is an elevated risk of disease outbreaks due to stagnant water conditions, overcrowding in IDP camps, inadequate access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health care.</p>\n<p>On 29 March, a patient tested positive for cholera at Mwanza district hospital. The patient, a Malawian, came from Mozambique. This brings the number of cases of cholera recorded in Malawi in 2019 to a total of nine of which three have been registered after the flooding event (one in flood affected Nsanje district and two in Mchinji district which is not among the flood affected districts).<br />\nThe Government is undertaking a PDNA in the areas impacted by the floods to determine recovery and reconstruction needs. The early-recovery cluster has been activated. With technical and financial support from a tripartite agreement between World bank, the UN and EU, the PDNA exercise started with an orientation session on 4 April and is expected to be completed by mid-April. All 15 districts and two cities affected by the floods will be included in the assessment with the level of detail being dependent on the degree of impact. The exercise will involve analysis of the effects (damage and losses), the impact (macroeconomic and human) and the estimation of recovery and reconstruction needs of the floods on key social, productive and infrastructure sectors.</p>\n",
