Situation Overview**\n\n• Flooding following Cyclone Idai in mid-March has now affected 270,000 people as of 30 March 2019.\n\n• The most heavily affected areas are the districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge in Manicaland which have been isolated due to roads and bridges being washed away. Mashonaland East (Chikomba district) and Masvingo (Zaka and Bikita districts) have also been affected.\n\n• The flood response is being led by the Department of Civil Protection at the national and provincial levels.\n\n• Two district command centres have been set up in Chimanimani and Chipinge. A logistics base has been set up in Mutare.\n\n• A Sector Coordinator and Information Management Officer have been deployed to Harare to support the response.\n\n• Besides Mutare, organisations are also positioning items in Skyline for distribution to affected areas.\n\n**2. Access Constraints**\n\n• Chimanimani and Chipinge districts remain mostly inaccessible by road due to roads and bridges having been heavily damaged by flood waters.\n\n• In Chimanimani a makeshift bridge has been constructed to access Copa and Chimanimani town from Chipinge but is only accessible using 4x4 vehicles.\n\n• The bridge on the road between Wengezi and Mutambara before the turn-off to Nhedziwa has also been damaged and parts of its structure swept away.\n\n• Bridges at Mhandarume, Matsororo, Mvumvumvu, Biriri, Muusha Primary School and Nyahode are all reported as damaged.\n\n• The road at Rusitu has been heavily damaged and can only be crossed by vehicles up to 10 mt in capacity.\n\n• The road from Mutare to Chimanimani is only accessible to Wengezi (all vehicle types).\n\n• The bridge located 10 km from Wengezi in the direction of Chimanimani is also water damaged so the route is inaccessible.\n\n• The road from Mutare to Chipinge is accessible to all vehicles.\n\n• The road from Chipinge to Chimanimani is accessible for vehicles up to 10 mt as far as Skyline.\n\n• Chimanimani town can only be accessed by 4x4 vehicle from Skyline. There is an alternative route that is being cleared however road conditions are extremely difficult due to mud. Government contractors are currently working to repair this road.\n\n• The road from Beira to Mutare is now open.",
