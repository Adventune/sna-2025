The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) has not been yet activated.\n\n• The Crisis Connectivity Charter has been activated and communications equipment is on the way to Mozambique from Dubai where the equipment was prepositioned.\n\n• ETC partners Ericsson Response, Government of Luxembourg and Télécoms Sans Frontières (TSF) have mobilized personnel and equipment to Mozambique to help provide communications services.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nMozambique is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The occurrence of natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, drought and earthquakes frequently has a significant impact on its people and the economy.  \nTropical Cyclone Idai - a category 3 cyclone - made landfall in Beira, Mozambique’s fourth largest city, on 14 March evening, resulting in wind speeds of up to 224km/h and heavy rains. Cyclone Idai is the strongest tropical cyclone to affect Central and North Mozambique since Tropical Cyclone Eline which struck the country in February 2000, claiming at least 800 lives.",
