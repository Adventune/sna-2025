As of 07 April, 334 people had been reported dead and over 257 people were reported missing due to the cyclone. An estimated one in ten people living in the affected provinces are living with HIV. During floods and droughts, vulnerability increases both for treatment attrition and increased transmission. The ICG has approved an emergency preventive oral cholera vaccination campaign. A total of 975,646 doses will be provided targeting 487,825 people from the age of one and above. UN agencies and non-governmental organizations launched a revised Humanitarian Flash Appeal in response to Cyclone Idai, requesting an additional US$60 million.  \nThis brings the total amount required by humanitarian partners to US$294 million, to complement national response efforts to drought, economic challenges and Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe. There has been an improvement in road access to the most affected communities. During the reporting week road access to Kopa growth point which was one of the most affected areas was established. Social workers who were deployed in the area reported that over 238 children lost one or both caregivers in the areas which has a total child population of approximately 3,000 children.",
