General Update** \n\n• According to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), analysis indicates that water levels continue to recede but are not yet below medium flood levels. Waters are, however, still rising in some minor watercourses in the Cheringoma Plateau (in Gorongosa National Park, Sofala province), the Savane, Sangussi and Zambazo, and peaks are forecasted until 2 April. Waters are also receding slowly in the Cuacua River, which flows through the Mopeia District of Zambezia province.\n\n• The risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains a major concern in the affected areas with cholera cases reported in Beira City and Nhamatanda and malaria cases reported in Beira City, Dondo and Nhamatanda.\n\n• Logistics Cluster’s partners were trained in Beira on the common logistics services made available to support their operations and how to access them. The Logistics Cluster requires partners to submit their Service Request Forms for transport and temporary storage at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.\n\n• The Logistics cluster is consolidating the upstream pipeline of humanitarian cargo coming into Mozambique to ensure a seamless provision of services and to avoid bottlenecks. Partners are encouraged to send their incoming cargo requests to florian.luckner@wfp.org.\n\n• During the Logistics Cluster meeting in Beira on 1 April, a new data-collection tool was showcased to assist in collecting real-time information on road access constraints in affected areas. Further details on downloading the tool will be shared with logistics partners by email.",
