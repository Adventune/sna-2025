Health actors had reported more than 6,250 cholera cases, including eight cholera-related deaths, and approximately 12,300 malaria cases in Sofala’s Beira and Dondo towns and Buzi and Nhamatanda districts as of April 17. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the GRM Ministry of Health (MoH) distributed more than 112,000 insecticide-treated bed nets in Dondo and Nhamatanda from April 8–12.\n\n- On April 9, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched a $614 million appeal to assist with recovery activities following Tropical Cyclone Idai. The appeal identifies education; emergency shelter support; and health, transportation, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure as priority areas for intervention.\n\n- Road access conditions are improving across much of Malawi’s Chikwawa, Nsanje, and Phalombe districts, as areas previously accessible only by air and boat can now be reached by ground transportation, the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the Logistics Cluster report. In addition, local authorities plan to repair the main runway at Chileka International Airport in Blantyre District, which could impact the plans of humanitarian agencies using the facility to transport commodities into southern Malawi following Tropical Cyclone Idai.",

Health actors had reported more than 6,250 cholera cases, including eight cholera-related deaths, and approximately 12,300 malaria cases in Sofala’s Beira and Dondo towns and Buzi and Nhamatanda districts as of April 17. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the GRM Ministry of Health (MoH) distributed more than 112,000 insecticide-treated bed nets in Dondo and Nhamatanda from April 8–12.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On April 9, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched a $614 million appeal to assist with recovery activities following Tropical Cyclone Idai. The appeal identifies education; emergency shelter support; and health, transportation, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure as priority areas for intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Road access conditions are improving across much of Malawi’s Chikwawa, Nsanje, and Phalombe districts, as areas previously accessible only by air and boat can now be reached by ground transportation, the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the Logistics Cluster report. In addition, local authorities plan to repair the main runway at Chileka International Airport in Blantyre District, which could impact the plans of humanitarian agencies using the facility to transport commodities into southern Malawi following Tropical Cyclone Idai.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
