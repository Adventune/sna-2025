This system is causing heavy rains (> 100mm in 24h) together with thunderstorms and strong winds. The system is moving towards the coastal region of Sofala and Zambézia provinces which may reach tropical cyclone stage influencing the weather conditions from 13 March 2019. The identified risk areas are the provinces of Zambézia, Sofala, Manica and Tete. The northern region of the country especially Niassa and Cabo Delgado province are also recording heavy rains.  \n\nGiven the weather forecast indicated by INAM, the national water resources authorities informed that in the next 72h might occur moderate to high urban flooding in the cities of Beira, Quelimane and Dondo where an estimated 20,000 people are at risk. Although there was a reduction in the rainfall in the last 24h, there is prevalence of flooded areas in the districts of Namacurra and Maganja da Costa in Zambézia province.  \n\nFurthermore, and as mentioned in the previous update, the Licungo, Zambeze, Pungoe and Buzi river basins might record a rise in the water levels and overcome the alert levels resulting in moderate to high flooding in the flooding plain of those rivers which may affect more than 100,000 people.  \n\nThe Government authorities are leading the response and together with the partners providing humanitarian assistance to the affected population.
