                "body": "**Key points** \n\n- Current data puts the number of houses damaged / destroyed as 216,000 houses. This is twice the number of houses originally estimated in the appeal, leaving a significant gap.  \n\n- Distributions are in process with over 83,000 people assisted to date, 29,000 tarpaulins distributed.  \n\n- Partners are unable to deliver full household kits due to lack of items, in stock and in pipeline.  \nCurrent pipeline gap of 61,000 tarpaulins, based on original appeal target. This calculation may change with revised damage data.  \n\n- Distribution capacity is limited. The new focus is on quality of programming and Operational partners are urgently required to scale up ability to distribute emergency shelter and NFI.  \n\n- Airlift operations are scaling back and renewed focus is on ground transportation wherever possible.  \n\n- Road access is improving, markets are recovering and affected populations are beginning their own self recovery where they have land and capacity to do so, but many remain cut off from roads, or displaced in evacuation centres and unable to return.  \n\n- Active CCCM sub-cluster is working in relocation sites and transit camps to establish safe living spaces and to ensure that sites are habitable before schools and other collective centres are closed. \n\n**Overall situation analysis** \n\nCategory 4 cyclone Idai made landfall on 14/03/19. High winds damaged and destroyed houses and infrastructure, and the ensuing flooding caused major additional damage and displacement. Although waters are receding, over 15,000 houses remain flooded.  \n\nAs of 05/04/2019, The Mozambique National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) damage data puts the total number of households damaged or destroyed at 103,537 partially destroyed, 97,424 totally destroyed, 15.784 flooded, or a total of 216,000 HH damaged / destroyed. Shelter damage assessment lead by the Government of Mozambique is ongoing.  \n\nBased on earlier estimates, the cluster is targeting 475,000 people in 87,500 households. This is based on 80,000 households targeted in the Flash appeal and 7,500 households in the Red Cross appeal.",
