Situation Update**\n\n• On 22 March, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) activated the Scale-Up protocol for a period of three months.\n\n• Pungue river and Buzi river water levels are reported to be decreasing in areas most affected by the cyclone and subsequent flooding. Dams levels are also reducing in volume, lowering alerts and reducing the risk of opening dams.\n\n• The Logistics Cluster has published Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for service provision (transport and temporary storage services). Service request forms are available on the Logistics Cluster website.  \nRequests must be submitted at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.\n\n• To avoid logistics bottlenecks and plan an adequate response, the Logistics Cluster continues to liaise with partners on the ground to consolidate pipelines. This information is particularly important for Beira airport, where increased information sharing will help ease congestions.",
