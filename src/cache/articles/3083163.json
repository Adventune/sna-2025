As of 13 April, the official death toll remained at 603 people, the number of houses destroyed or damaged remained at 239,731, and the number of displaced people in collective sites remained at 73,296, as there was no new data released by the Government. \n\nThere are still reports of communities who remain cut-off. A few days ago, as part of the COSACA consortium and in partnership with local organisation CECOHAS, Oxfam travelled to Gentivo in Zambézia Province, which was hit by heavy flooding in early March as the storm first made its way over land. The team found some 2,000 people in Gentivo in need of assistance, with an estimated 4,000 more remaining without access. Up to that point, the community were surviving off dates, coconuts and a few small fish they could catch, according to [Oxfam](https://reliefweb.int/node/3082753). Likewise, in Manica Province, some areas, particularly Mossurize and Sussundenga districts, are still difficult to reach and several communities in the Chefe de Posto Administrativo in Dombé, report being cut-off.",
