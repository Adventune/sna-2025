The hardest-hit district of Chimanimani remains inaccessible as heavy rains have damaged roads and main access bridges have been washed away.\n\nAt least 82 deaths and over 200 injuries have been reported, mainly in Chimanimani, and 217 people are reportedly missing. Chimanimani mortuary is reportedly full. At least 923 homes have been destroyed in Chimanimani, Mutasa, Mutare, Chipinge, Buhera, Chikomba, Gutu and Bikita districts. In Chimanimani alone, eight bridges have been destroyed. In Buhera, the Marowanyati dam has overflowed and many families are displaced. Crops and livestock have been destroyed in all affected areas. Overall, more than 2,500 households (12,500 to 15,000 people) are estimated to be affected. However, an accurate assessment of the number of people impacted and displaced is difficult to establish at this point, as many district wards remain inaccessible.\n\nMeanwhile, damage to the port in Beira and its access roads in neighbouring Mozambique may affect fuel and food supplies to Zimbabwe, as well as livelihoods of people in the eastern regions of the country that rely heavily on the Zimbabwe/Mozambique trading corridor.",
