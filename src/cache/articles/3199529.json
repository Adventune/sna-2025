According to information from the Provincial Government, which was shared during the daily meeting with clusters\n\non 16 April, in Mandruzi 202 plots were demarcated, none assigned; in Mutua 154 plots were demarcated, none assigned.\n\n**Observations**\n\nThe team drove to Mandruzi village and asked several people, including the pastor and the area community leader about the proposed resettlement site. However no-one was able to provide any information, indicating that they were not aware of plans/land allocation. The team also asked the vice Bairro administrator who appeared to know about the project but hesitated to provide exact location information when asked. He referred the team to the Bairro administrator who was absent at the time of visit. The hesitation to share information of the site location, combined with lack of knowledge from community members suggests that site may not be ready as reported.\n\nThe contact information of the Bairro administrator: Jorge Cosmo, +258 84 55 70 430 & +258 84 55 76 429.\n\nAction: Contact INGC and propose a joint visit to the proposed resettlement sites.",
