It requires a total of US$1.2 million to provide critical communications services in up to four operational areas for six months along with a number of connection sites including accommodation centres, health centres, distribution points and humanitarian hubs.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nFunding towards the revised Humanitarian Response Plan, calling for US$337.2 million (including $282 million for the Cyclone Idai response) has reached 24.3 per cent. Multiple Member States have provided financial contributions for the humanitarian response in Mozambique, with at least $116.2 million recorded in the Financial Tracking System (FTS) as of 15 April, of which $82.1 million has been allocated against the appeal.\n\nThe number of internally displaced people living in accommodation centres was 77,003 people as of 20 April. At least 240 people were relocated from Beira City to Guara Guara where most are staying as they begin to rebuild their homes.",
