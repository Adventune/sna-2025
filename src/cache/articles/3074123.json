The campaign is covering Beira city and other districts including Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi. The vaccination campaign is being carried out in accommodation centres, health units and mobile units with 884,000 people expected to be vaccinated.  \n\nAs of 6 April, there were 2,772 cholera cases recorded in Beira, Dondo, Buzi and Nhamatanda and death toll of 05 people.Most of the cases have been reported in Beira (2,188 cases), followed by Nhamatanda (271 cases), and Dondo (289). On 04 April, the health authorities confirmed new cases of cholera in Buzi distric,t with 24 cases by 06 April. The cholera taskforce is holding daily meetings in Beira to inform operational response and community sensitization is on-going on radio and through printed communication materials to convey messages related to communicable disease control and when to seek health-care. There are 14 cholera treatment centres (CTC) in Sofala – eight in Beira city, three in Nhamatanda and the remaining in Dondo and Buzi.  \n\nThe Ministry of Health through the National Institute of Health and partners continue collecting samples of water sources in cholera affected areas and together with other line ministries carry out measures on sanitation, education, community mobilisation, and water trucking and distribution of CERTEZA.  \n\nAccording to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), at least 1,514,445 people were affected by the cyclone and floods in the central region of the country and the death toll has risen to 602. Reportedly, at least 223,898 houses were partially or totally destroyed.  \n\nAs of 07 April, 142,327 people have been displaced due to the cyclone and flooding. The displaced people are largely hosted in 139 transit centres in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces. The largest number of transit centres are in Sofala where at least 121,322 people are hosted in 111 centres. From 1 – 5 April the Government closed at least 17 transit centres, most of them in Zambezia and Sofala provinces relocating about 4,142 people to new locations. In some cases families have been assigned land plots. According to INGC at least 263,181 students are affected by the floods and cyclones due to the damage of 3,359 classrooms in Sofala, Manica,  \nZambezia and Tete provinces. At least 54 health facilities are affected in Sofala, Manica and Zambézia.  \n\nAccess by road remains a challenge in several areas. Preliminary reports from a joint Government-inter-agency mission from Vilankulos to Sofala Province indicate that Chibabava is accessible by road and surrounding remote areas remain accessible by air only. There are five collective centres in Chibabava, only one of which (Xinhika) is reachable by road. The rest (Goonda Madjaca (403 households), Gerome (375 households), Xinhica Mudava (142 households), Xiquaxa (93 households) and Escola Secundaria File Jacnto Nyusse (09 households) are not reachable by road but have received some assistance by air from Beira. The Buzi district, the most flood affected area, is now accessible by road. However, Buzi north remains difficult to access but accessibility is expected to improve as repairs continues.",
