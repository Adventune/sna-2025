The Situation Report builds on Flash Updates #1 through #15 and provides detailed information on the situation and response by sector. The next report will be issued as of 16 April 2019.* \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS** \n\n• The cholera epidemiological curve showed a reduction on 14 and 15 April, in line with the expected trajectory of the outbreak following the oral vaccination campaign.\n\n• Meanwhile, malaria cases continue to rise, with 10,689 reported between 27 March and 15 April.\n\n• More than 13,000 children and youth have been provided with learning materials to resume school.\n\n• Over 93,200 bottles of Certeza (a water purification product) have been distributed as part of the response. \n\n1.85M People in need \n\n5,897 Cholera cases \n\n603 Deaths \n\n~70K Displaced people in 69 collective sites \n\n~1.1M People assisted with food \n\n907K People reached with water support \n\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW** \n\nIt has been one month since Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique, bringing death and destruction to large swathes of the central region of the country and leaving an estimated 1.85 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, including around 1 million children, and an estimated 74,650 pregnant women. One-month on, more than 1 million people have been reached with emergency assistance. However, although flood waters have receded in many areas, humanitarian needs remain high and there is an urgent need for additional funding to support the continued scale-up of the response and prevent further loss of life.  \n\nAs of 15 April, the official death toll has remained at 603 people and the number of houses destroyed or damaged remained at 239,731. The number of displaced people in collective sites were at 70,610.  \n\nOn the cholera situation, as of 15 April, 241 new cases were reported, raising the total number of cholera cases to 5,897. However, the epidemiological trend began to show a decrease in the number of daily cases, following the oral cholera vaccination campaign. Malaria cases, on the other hand, continued to increase and reached 10,689 cases on 15 April.",

One-month on, more than 1 million people have been reached with emergency assistance. However, although flood waters have receded in many areas, humanitarian needs remain high and there is an urgent need for additional funding to support the continued scale-up of the response and prevent further loss of life.</p>\n<p>As of 15 April, the official death toll has remained at 603 people and the number of houses destroyed or damaged remained at 239,731. The number of displaced people in collective sites were at 70,610.</p>\n<p>On the cholera situation, as of 15 April, 241 new cases were reported, raising the total number of cholera cases to 5,897. However, the epidemiological trend began to show a decrease in the number of daily cases, following the oral cholera vaccination campaign. Malaria cases, on the other hand, continued to increase and reached 10,689 cases on 15 April.</p>\n",
