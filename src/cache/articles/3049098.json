The Government of Mozambique (GoM) reported at least 281 confirmed deaths in the country as of March 22, with the numbers expected to rise significantly in the coming days. An estimated 1.7 million people were in the direct path of the cyclone, and 600,000 people are in need of urgent assistance or at risk due to continued flooding, according to the GoM. While Beira is reportedly 90 percent destroyed, there is a strong likelihood of greater destruction outside of the city.\n\n- On March 19, the GoM declared a national emergency due to the effects of the cyclone.  \nOn the same day, U.S. Ambassador to Mozambique Dennis W. Hearne declared a disaster due to the impact of the cyclone. On March 19, USAID/OFDA staff began arriving in Mozambique to support response effort; the following day, USAID activated a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to lead the USG response, as well as a Washington, D.C.-based Response Management Team (RMT) to support the DART.  \nThe DART and RMT are responding to the situation in coordination with other USG counterparts, GoM representatives, and humanitarian partners.\n\n- The DART plans to prioritize emergency food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions given the extensive needs identified in these sectors during initial assessments. As of March 22, USAID had provided $200,000 toward the humanitarian response to the cyclone in Mozambique and was communicating with humanitarian partners on the ground to determine additional needs. USAID is also working to dispatch relief commodities from the agency’s warehouses in United Arab Emirates’ city of Dubai and Italy’s city of Pisa to Mozambique for distribution by humanitarian partners.",
