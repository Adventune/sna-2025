As of 10 April, the official death toll had risen to 602 people, an increase of 84 since 1 April; with more than 1,641 people injured, according to the Government. Although the majority of areas have now been reached the death toll is expected to continue to rise slightly as areas previously cut-off become reachable by road and the full extent of the damage becomes known.  \n\nOn 22 March, the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Principals declared a IASC Principles of the “humanitarian system-wide scale upon for a period of 3 months and activated 9 Clusters. WHO Mozambique was designated as the humanitarian Cluster Lead Agency (CLA) of the Health Cluster to provide support to the Ministry of Health\".",
