Dams levels are also reducing in volume, lowering alerts and reducing the risk of opening dams.\n\n• Reports of acute diarrhoea cases are increasing in areas impacted by the cyclone and floods, although the exact number of cases is yet to be confirmed.\n\n• One Logistics Cluster officer was deployed on 26 March to Chimoio to engage with partners and conduct a gaps and needs assessment to verify the need for the provision of common services.\n\n• The Logistics Cluster has published Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for service provision (transport and temporary storage services). Service request forms are available on the Logistics Cluster website. Requests must be submitted at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.",
