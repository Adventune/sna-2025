                "body": "**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- UN revises 2019 Mozambique HRP to account for needs generated by Tropical Cyclone Idai\n\n- USAID DART observes humanitarian conditions and conducts assessment of accommodation centers in Beira\n\n- USAID/OFDA commodities begin to arrive in Mozambique on March 30\n\n- At USAID’s request, DoD provides logistics support for the Mozambique response\n\n**KEY DEVELOPMENTS**\n\n- The Government of Mozambique (GoM) reported at least 493 confirmed deaths due to Tropical Cyclone Idai as of March 29. The cyclone also damaged or destroyed more than 99,300 houses, according to the GoM. Casualty figures and damage estimates are expected to continue to rise as flood waters recede and relief agencies identify additional deaths and conduct assessments. Nearly 140,800 people were sheltering in more than 161 accommodation sites in Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambézia provinces as of March 29, the GoM reports.\n\n- The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Mozambique released a revised 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) on March 25, requesting nearly $282 million to respond to the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Idai. An estimated 1.85 million people are in need of assistance due to the effects of the cyclone, an increase from the initial estimates of 600,000 people, according to the HRP. The appeal identifies food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance as priority needs in affected areas.\n\n- On March 27, USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members traveled to Sofala’s Beira city to observe humanitarian conditions and assess needs in and around the city. The team noted that markets in Beira were operational and observed food and household items for sale. However, hygiene conditions at accommodation centers were poor and food and other supplies provided by humanitarian agencies were insufficient for the number of people in need.\n\n- In addition to the impacts in Mozambique, Tropical Cyclone Idai also caused damage, destruction, and deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. In Zimbabwe, the cyclone resulted in 181 deaths and affected at least 237,000 people, while at least 367,200 people were affected in Malawi. Two USAID/OFDA staff members deployed to Zimbabwe on March 28 to verify unmet needs in the country. The staff members plan to travel to Malawi in the coming days to assess the extent of humanitarian needs in the country.",

The cyclone also damaged or destroyed more than 99,300 houses, according to the GoM. Casualty figures and damage estimates are expected to continue to rise as flood waters recede and relief agencies identify additional deaths and conduct assessments. Nearly 140,800 people were sheltering in more than 161 accommodation sites in Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambézia provinces as of March 29, the GoM reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Mozambique released a revised 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) on March 25, requesting nearly $282 million to respond to the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Idai. An estimated 1.85 million people are in need of assistance due to the effects of the cyclone, an increase from the initial estimates of 600,000 people, according to the HRP. The appeal identifies food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance as priority needs in affected areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On March 27, USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members traveled to Sofala’s Beira city to observe humanitarian conditions and assess needs in and around the city. The team noted that markets in Beira were operational and observed food and household items for sale. However, hygiene conditions at accommodation centers were poor and food and other supplies provided by humanitarian agencies were insufficient for the number of people in need.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition to the impacts in Mozambique, Tropical Cyclone Idai also caused damage, destruction, and deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. In Zimbabwe, the cyclone resulted in 181 deaths and affected at least 237,000 people, while at least 367,200 people were affected in Malawi. Two USAID/OFDA staff members deployed to Zimbabwe on March 28 to verify unmet needs in the country. The staff members plan to travel to Malawi in the coming days to assess the extent of humanitarian needs in the country.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
