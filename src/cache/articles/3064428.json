                "body": "**Highlights**\n\n- The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) Services for   Communities  (S4C)  advisor   has so   far conducted assessments  of  four  community  radio  stations  in  Beira, Dondo and Buzi to explore potential S4C projects.\n\n- To date,867humanitarians at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)in Beira are registered to access ETC Internet connectivity to enable them to do their work.\n\n- The  ETC still  requiresUS$1.2  millionto  provide  critical communications  services  in  up  to  four EOCsfor  three monthsalong  with  a  number of connection  sites  for accommodation centres, health centres, distribution points and joint location NGOs.\n\n**Situation Overview**\n\nThe  official  death  toll  of  Cyclone  Idai  has  now surpassed  the  500  mark,  according  to  the  latest  government figures. An  estimated  141,000  displaced  people  were  sheltering  in  161  sites  across  Sofala  (109,700  people), Manica (15,200 people), Zambezia (13,200 people), Tete (2,650 people) as of 30 March. In 22 sites, it was reported that  damaged  or  destroyed  houses  were  the  primary  reason  preventing  people  from  returning  home.  The remaining reasons were accessibility, basic infrastructure damage, lack of food and no livelihoods.\n\nThere were 246 cases of cholera reported across Beira City (211) and Nhamatanda (35) by 30 March, and 535 cases of diarrhoea in Beira City (300), Dondo (200) and Nhamtanda (35). Meanwhile, 276 cases of malaria were reportedin  Beira  City  (101),  Dondo  (152)  and  Nhamtanda  (23).  There  remains  a  high-risk  of  spread  of  both water-borne and vector-borne diseases.\n\nWater levels continue to recede but are not yet below medium flood levels.",
